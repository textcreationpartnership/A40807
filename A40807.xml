            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I cannot doubt your <hi>Graces</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of this deſign, which is at all times uſeful, but more eſpecially in this preſent Juncture of Affairs, if God pleaſe to grant ſucceſs, which is my earneſt prayer.

            <opener>
               <salute>Chriſtian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE deſign of this diſcourſe being to <hi>remove</hi> or at leaſt to <hi>allay</hi> thoſe fierce contentions about the external forms of worſhip, to which we owe all thoſe unhappy Schiſms, which good men ſo heartily bewail, it was neceſſary in order to this end to rectifie thoſe <hi>miſtakes</hi> and <hi>prejudices,</hi> which abuſe well-minded men, who have not throughly conſider'd things; and to correct thoſe corrupt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that quarrelſom and contentious humour, which perverts others.</p>
            <p>To theſe two cauſes we owe moſt of our preſent diſorders, &amp; it is too evident, what hand the latter of theſe has had in them, while divers Perſons wanting a due ſenſe of the evil and danger of theſe diſcords, and a due regard to the Peace and Unity of the Church, have been too zealous and forward to maintain and promote ſuch diſſenſions, thereby to ſerve the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> of their own <hi>parties,</hi> and to oppoſe the ſettlement of the Church upon ſure and laſting principles: now I had no other
<pb facs="tcp:42052:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>way of dealing with theſe men, but to convince them of the great evil of ſuch contentions, and how much it is the duty of every Chriſtian to ſtudy Peace and Unity. For there is nothing more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, than that mens minds are ſtrangely byaſſed by their affections and Intereſts, and clouded by paſſion, and therefore <hi>while they are ſo peremptorily reſolved upon their way, while they are ſo fond of their own Inventions, while they are devoted to the ſervice of a Party, and account thoſe men their Enemies, who ſhould rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them, and inform them better; there is no expectation, that reaſon and argument ſhould prevail with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if thoſe arguments, which I have made uſe of for this purpoſe, ſhould be effectual to calm the paſſions of men, and to work in them a Chriſtian and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able temper of mind, I can eaſily foretel the ſucceſs of my following diſcourſe, the deſign of which is to rectifie thoſe miſtakes and miſapprehenſions, which ſome men labour under, which either concern the particular <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>offices</hi> of our Church, or the <hi>General rule of duty, or Eccleſiaſtical liberty,</hi> by which the Church muſt be directed and guided in matters of order.</p>
            <p>The firſt hath occaſion'd various ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
<pb facs="tcp:42052:7"/>againſt ſome Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and particular paſſages in our forms of Prayer, and I have ſpent great part of this Treatiſe in anſwering ſuch objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by which I hope it will appear, what little reaſon there is to diſturb the Peace of the Church, and to ſeparate from our Communion upon ſuch pretences.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>General Rule,</hi> which ought ever to be obſerved in the Church about matters of order, there are ſome, who will allow nothing (except ſome few circumſtances) to be determined by the Authority of the Church, unleſs it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly enjoined by a particular divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and for a more plauſible co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour they reject all ſuch rules of order or regular adminiſtration, under the terms of <hi>unſcriptural conditions of Communion.</hi> But in anſwer to this I have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be an unjuſt and unreaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt the eſtabliſht order of any Church, that there are ſome things deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and appointed by the Authority of Superiours, which have always been accounted of an <hi>Indifferent</hi> nature, and are indeed the proper matters of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Liberty:</hi> And I hope, I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved to the ſatisfaction of all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber inquirers, that prudent and well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments
<pb facs="tcp:42052:8"/>for the promoting order and decency, and the advancement of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Piety, are very allowable and unblameable; nay that it is impoſſible, that any publick worſhip or ſervice of God can be performed, unleſs ſome things in thoſe adminiſtrations, not particularly commanded by God, be determined ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>by publick Authority,</hi> or by <hi>common agreement,</hi> which makes it neceſſary for all men either to relinquiſh this principle, or which is more ſhameful, to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it in their practice.</p>
            <p>I am not unſenſible, what rewards ſuch attempts, as this, commonly meet with from men of diſtemper'd minds, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govern'd paſſions: I have carefully avoided all juſt occaſion of offence, as hoping, that I may the more effectually perſwade, the leſs I anger them; but if nothing will ſecure me from Invectives and Calumnies. I muſt be contented with my portion, and appeal to the judgment of more candid and impartial Readers, and ſatisfie my ſelf with the Teſtimony of God and my own Conſcience of the honeſty of my intentions and deſign in this work, leaving the ſucceſs of it to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, with my hearty and ſerious Prayers, that it may be for the publick benefit of the Church.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

                     </gap>, a <hi>ſmall matter</hi> is then <hi>no ſmall matter,</hi> when it bringeth in a great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor can we eaſily find a more full inſtance hereof, than in the preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Conformity.</hi> For the <hi>diſcovering</hi> how great the <hi>good or evil</hi> is, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth thereupon, is not to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, chiefly from the bare eying the things required and appointed, many of which are in their own nature things <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different;</hi> but from obſerving its neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary attendants, which are of very high conſequence and great concernment. Wherefore I ſhall firſt take an account, what <hi>great</hi> and <hi>manifold evils</hi> flow from theſe <hi>diſſentions,</hi> and oppoſitions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this will appear to be a matter deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſerious conſideration, and that the maintaining ſuch diſſentions, unleſs they proceed upon neceſſary and juſtifiable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42052:11"/>grounds, (which I ſhall examine) is <hi>upon many weighty accounts</hi> utterly diſallowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and greatly condemnable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From theſe contentions doth ſpring much want of <hi>Chriſtian love,</hi> and that kindneſs of affection, which our <hi>Lord</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, and by many cogent arguments enforceth upon his Diſciples; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof we may hear many <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous, ſcoffing,</hi> and <hi>ſcorning</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which are an evidence of a frothy and airy vanity and haughtineſs of mind, unſuitable to the <hi>gravity and humility</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Spirit.</hi> Yea, hence much diſcourſe of many men religiouſly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which might be well <hi>improved</hi> to a pious <hi>proficiency in the Chriſtian life,</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth up into the wilder branches of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;</hi> and that <hi>zeal</hi> which might be well employed, is oft miſ-ſpent in che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the flames of <hi>paſſionate heats,</hi> and <hi>heart-burnings,</hi> accompanied with too much <hi>bitterneſs,</hi> and becometh that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which St. <hi>James</hi> ſo ſharply cenſureth and condemneth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.14, 15.</note> as being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly oppoſite to thoſe religious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices unto which Chriſtians are directed from above.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This oppoſition hath alſo too much promoted many <hi>ſinful prejudices</hi> in the ſpirits of Men: hence ſome have their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42052:12"/>minds unreaſonably prepoſſeſſed, with ſo much averſeneſs towards, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem of the publick adminiſtrations of Gods ſervice, as <hi>indiſpoſeth</hi> them for a devout performance of that worſhip, and <hi>hindreth</hi> the <hi>vigorous exerciſe</hi> of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Graces in their joining therein, to the decay of piety. It occaſioneth others to be <hi>neglectful</hi> in their <hi>attendance,</hi> even upon the holy Sacramental Inſtitutions of our bleſſed Saviour; and this ſame ſin of prejudice ſometimes ruleth ſo far, as to promote <hi>raſhneſs</hi> of <hi>judgment</hi> and great cenſoriouſneſs of others, contrary to the Goſpel rule, and therein blindeth mens minds, and hurrieth their paſſions into great exceſſes. By all which things <hi>God</hi> is diſpleaſed, and <hi>Chriſtian Charity</hi> is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, but the greateſt hurt befalleth themſelves, by their <hi>ſlighting the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a Religious life,</hi> and either fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently neglecting, or negligently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the publick duties of Gods worſhip, and not entertaining the means of their Salvation; which includeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a want of due reſpect unto God and his grace.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And what <hi>ſtrange apprehenſions</hi> this Sin is prone to raiſe of the worthieſt men, may be beſt diſcovered in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances. Hereby they who could
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42052:12"/>not but admire the Works and Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did both <hi>reject him,</hi> and cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly <hi>cenſure him,</hi> as <hi>breaking the Sabbath, blaſpheming God, being an Enemy to</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, <hi>and a greater friend to Publicans and Sinners</hi> than was allowable, and at laſt cryed out, <hi>Crucify him, Crucify him.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">Of its being an unlawful Oath.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THE acknowledgment to be made by Miniſters, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Covenant,</hi> being no permanent Conſtitution, may require the ſhorter diſcourſe. Yet it is needful that ſo much be ſaid as to manifeſt that while it is for the preſent continued, and until it ſhall be withdrawn and abated, it ought not to be an obſtacle to any, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon Eccleſiaſtical adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (or civil offices.) To this end I ſhall firſt conſider the Oath it ſelf, that it was <hi>n it ſelf unlawful;</hi> and then its <hi>obligation</hi> ſo far as that is concerned in this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now an Oath may be accounted <hi>unlawful in it ſelf,</hi> with reſpect to the wholſom laws of the land: and upon this account any Oath eſpecially concerning publick affairs of Government, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in it ſelf, where either the matter, or the conſtitution and framing, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warantable
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42052:43"/>according to the law. That the Covenant (and its Impoſition) was in this reſpect <hi>unlawful,</hi> will be eaſily admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all impartially conſidering perſons, who cannot be ſuppoſed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that whatſoever (either for, or againſt their own intereſt) obtaineth in any wiſe a vote in the two Houſes, but is not aſſented to, but diſallowed by the King, hath a ſufficient legal and <hi>warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſtitution.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">13. <hi>Car.</hi> 2.1.</note> And accordingly by the higheſt authoritative way of reſolution, this Oath is declared <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful,</hi> by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Act in our Statute Laws.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And its not having a legal Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution (beſides what reſpecteth the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular matter thereof) is ſufficient to render it unlawful in it ſelf, according to the <hi>law of God,</hi> which eſtabliſheth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, commandeth obedience to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſubjection to all wholſom hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane laws.

                  <p n="4">4. But touching the matter of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant being unlawful, I might note, that that clauſe expreſſing them who take the Covenant to <hi>be of one reformed Religion,</hi> and that they had <hi>before their eyes the glory of God, and the honour of the King;</hi> was either not ſo true, or not ſo well known concerning one another, as that they might ſafely expreſs it in a warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Oath. And what concerned the <hi>doctrine, worſhip, diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland, was that which could not be underſtood, as the matter of an Oath ſhould be, by ordinary
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42052:44"/>perſons in <hi>England</hi> who were required to take it. And that clauſe, declaring that this Covenant was made <hi>according to the commendable practice of theſe Kingdoms in former times,</hi> did not only require them who took it to be well ſkilled in Hiſtory, but alſo declareth former open combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Subjects by Oath, againſt the mind and will of their Prince, to alter the affairs of Government, to be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable practices:</hi> which is to aſſert what is contrary unto truth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And how much it was in the matter of it Unlawful, by its deſigned tendency to promote a civil War (even againſt the King) may alſo be conſidered. For though the King was known to oppoſe this Oath, yet the Covenant engaged them who took it, <hi>according to their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and callings to aſſiſt and defend all thoſe that entred into this League and Covenant in the maintenance and purſuing thereof.</hi> And alſo that they ſhould <hi>all the days of their lives coniinue therein againſt all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</hi> And that this phraſe <hi>according to our places and callings,</hi> was not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood nor intended in the Covenant, and by the contrivers thereof, in the due li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited ſenſe (though many private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons did ſo take it)is manifeſt by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what kind of <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> to each

                  <p n="6">6. As this Covenant had reſpect to the affairs of the Church, it appeareth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful upon a double account. 1. That <hi>endeavour,</hi> intended in the Covenant for the alteration of Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government, was in the nature thereof an Unlawful endeavour: for thereby Subjects did undertake of themſelves, though without legal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and without and againſt the Kings conſent, to alter, oppoſe, and expel what was eſtabliſhed by the Laws of the Land.

                  <p n="1">1. Though ſome phraſes in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which had reſpect to the King, were truly declared by himſelf to be <hi>dubious and dangerous,</hi> and were to ſuch purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made uſe of by ſome violent Spirits, yet I ſhall preſume it now granted, that no man is by that Oath obliged to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour any alteration of the Government in the State. But I ſhall here undertake to manifeſt, that there lyeth <hi>no obligation from the Covenant</hi> upon any perſon who took it, <hi>to endeavour any alteration of the Government in the Church,</hi> though he might intend this in his entring upon that Oath. And this I ſhall evidence by propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four Rules.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The firſt Rule is, That <hi>Superiours juſt rights may not be violated.</hi> But if the voluntary Vows or Oaths of Inferiours, made againſt the conſent and command of their Superiours, concerning things belonging to their Government (which is the preſent caſe) did bind them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute what they did ſo undertake; then
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42052:48"/>muſt it be acknowledged lawful, that the Superiours right and authority be taken away, without his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that the duties of Obedience, the divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Rule and Dominion, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether therewith all peace may be rooted out of the World. This will be manifeſt by conſidering the Oath of a <hi>Servant,</hi> that he will not do ſuch buſineſs as he thinketh his Maſter intendeth for him; of a <hi>Child,</hi> that he will have none of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe orders, nor ſervants in his Fathers family, which his Father approveth; or of an <hi>Army,</hi> that they will not engage in a Battel, or undertakeany march though they be thereto commanded. And like to theſe is the Oath of a <hi>Subject,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine matters of publick Government, againſt the law, and the mind of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign. And if other inferiours ſhould in the like caſe as forwardly make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vows; if theſe ſhould alſo be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to neceſſary obligation againſt their ſuperiours right, this would <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate endleſs quarrels</hi> between theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and <hi>baniſh ſubjection</hi> from them both.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And a very great conſent of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of different perſwaſions in other things, ight be produced, to ſhew that ſuch Oaths of Inferiours cannot be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory:

                     </note> being many years ſince therein reprinted, and was long before urged to this purpoſe, by the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford.</hi> After this among otehr large conceſſions, the King decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he could not conſent to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> both from <hi>Newport</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>wight, Sept.</hi> 29. 1648. and from <hi>Holmby, May</hi> 12. 1647. Wherefore the King did ſeveral times manifeſt his diſallowing the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42052:49"/>Covenant, and even with particular reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to its endeavouring the <hi>alteration</hi> of the Government in the Church, as may be collected from the view of his own words: and thereby any intended obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from this Oath, to alter this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, became thenceforth void to all his ſubjects, agreeably to the like caſe. <hi>Num.</hi> 39.9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; yet in all theſe different ways of reſolution, there is a ſufficient agreement, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubſtance and ſenſe of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical doctrine. But this their doctrine our Saviour condemneth, as a <hi>tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Commandment of God by their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi> Mat. 15.3. and <hi>making the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God of none effect.</hi> v. 6. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now the ſame command, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother</hi> (and divers precepts of the Goſpel) doth enjoin obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Governours and Rulers. And our Soveraign and our Laws do eſtabliſh the preſent Government in the Church, and thereby do require ſubjects to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it and receive it; and therefore according to the doctrine of Chriſt, no Vow or Oath ought to be accounted to diſoblige men from this duty of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is enjoined by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.<note place="margin">Second Paper of Propoſals 1661.</note> And the pretence made by ſome, that they are <hi>far from thinking that the Covenant obliged them to reſiſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but yet it doth undoubtedly oblige to forbear their own conſent to what they there renounced;</hi> this would agree well with the intent of the Phariſees tradition, while the Son might tell his Father, that he acknowledged his vow could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to do his Father wrong; but yet
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42052:50"/>he was bound that in theſe preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances he might not conſent to yield him relief. But ſuch things are of a direct contrary tendency to the doctrines of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A third Rule is, <hi>That every obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Oath of contract, ceaſeth by the mutual content of the contractors;</hi> and therefore, had the Covenant been every way warrantable, the obligation by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract therein, to endeavour the alteration of the Government of the Church, would have ceaſed, by the Parliaments of all theſe three Nations diſclaiming any ſuch obligation.<note place="margin">

                     </note> And that ſuch an Oath cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to bind, when we have the deſire or conſent of them to whoſe concernment it hath particular reference, is aſſerted by ſuch Writers as treat of this matter, as <hi>Aquinas, Grotius,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Saunderſon, Ameſius,</hi> and divers others; and this hath been alſo admitted and inſiſted upon, by ſome chief defenders of the Covenant, particularly by Mr. <hi>Henderſon,</hi> in his firſt Paper to the King. And the reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is evident, becauſe every perſon, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, or community, may recede from their own right and priviledge. Thus after the <hi>two ſpies</hi> had made a general Oath to <hi>Rahab,</hi> to preſerve her and her Fathers houſe alive (which was a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42052:50"/>ſhe obtained) by agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and them it was reſolved,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joſ.</hi> 2.12, 13, 17,—21.</note> that this Oath ſhould not bind, if either ſhe or her Fathers family, were not within the <hi>doors of her houſe.</hi> And thus if any two Kingdoms ſhould <hi>by Oath engage,</hi> to trafick in ſome commodities with none other but among themſelves only; if this contract be afterwards judged pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to both their intereſts, and the publick authority on both ſides yield to have it <hi>altered,</hi> and <hi>quit all claim</hi> of any ſuch peculiar right of trade, the obligation of that Oath is thereby <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. That the Covenant was deſigned to be an Oath of contract, between divers ſubjects of theſe Nations appeareth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as it is all along ſtiled the ſolemn <hi>League</hi> and Covenant, ſo in the beginning thereof it is declared, <hi>We the Noblemen, Barons, &amp;c. determined to enter into a mutual and ſolemn League and Covenant:</hi> and a <hi>mutual League</hi> cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than an Oath of contract. And whereas this Oath in the ſixth Article thereof, is ſtiled their <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,</hi> and in the end of it, it is called <hi>an aſſociation and Covenant,</hi> all this doth intimate, that its obligation was intended towards one another. Wherefore ſince
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42052:51"/>any obligation from the Covenant to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Government, is diſclaimed and rejected by the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and alſo by the reſciſſory act (as I find it termed) in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it muſt hereby become void, though it had been otherwiſe binding.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. A fourth Rule is, <hi>That what the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral judgment of the beſt Chriſtians of all ages have condemned as ſin, ought not to be admitted.</hi> But they have all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it a ſin, that an Oath ſo far as it is againſt any right, ſhould be perſiſted in as being obligatory. And it is as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to doubt, of ordinary travellers knowing the road they have long uſed, as to queſtion whether the moſt eminent Chriſtians ſince Chriſt, did ever arrive at the underſtanding of thoſe plain duties of Religion, which are of frequent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Declaration and Subſcription referring to the Liturgy.</head>
               <p n="1">1. SOme open acknowledgment or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, not only to doctrines, but alſo to other <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions,</hi> hath been a thing very uſual in the Chriſtian Church; and in matters lawful and orderly, hath been thought deſireable to promote Peace, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue well eſtabliſhed order therein; and the expediency thereof ſtandeth recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, by the wiſdom and ordinary practice of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conc. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen. c. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> the return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Novatians</hi> who were received in the Clergy, were required by <hi>ſubſcription</hi> to teſtify, that they would conform to the Catholick practice, and the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Decrees of the Catholick Church. The ancient Cuſtom of ſubſcribing to their Synodical Conſtitutions,<note place="margin">Conc. Carth. gr. c. <hi>93.</hi> Conc. Carth. <hi>2.</hi> Can. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> is evident from divers ancient Councils: which was alſo practiſed in the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Territories, where ſuch who acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their profeſſion or ſubſcription, were ſharply ſentenced. And in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42052:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> according to ſome Copies, he who was to be ordained Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, beſides his <hi>ſubſcribing</hi> to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Faith, and his <hi>Oath</hi> againſt <hi>Simony,</hi> was required to read the offices of the Church, for the holy Communion, and with the other Prayers of the Church,<note place="margin">Novel. <hi>123.</hi> edit.

And he who (as he was required) did teſtifie his allowance of theſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by reading them, might as well have teſtified the ſame, by any other vocal acknowledgment or ſubſcription.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Among the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the practice of ſubſcription to ſuch things (as alſo that which is more ſolemn, an <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment by Oath</hi>) hath been frequently admitted. In <hi>Poland,</hi> after the <hi>conſent</hi> (chiefly touching the Lords Supper) was eſtabliſhed in the Synod of <hi>Sandomir,</hi> 1570. between the Churches of thoſe three Confeſſions, the <hi>Bohemian, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> and <hi>Helvetian;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Syn. Torun. <hi>2585.</hi>
                  </note> it was concluded in another following General Synod, and atteſted by the Super-Intendents, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Patrons of the ſeveral Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that none ſhould be admitted into the Miniſtry, or received into their Churches as a Miniſter, unleſs (among other qualifications) <hi>conſenſui ſubſcribat,</hi> he ſubſcribe to the conſent, and behave
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42052:53"/>himſelf accordingly. Which proviſion contained a prudential care, that a due <hi>decorum</hi> ſhould be kept, even in the <hi>Agenda</hi> of Religion. The <hi>French Church</hi> requireth a ſubſcription to their Liturgy; and the like may be obſerved in divers other places.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Church, after the time of their ordination, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, <hi>manuum Epiſcopalium impoſitione,</hi>

                  </note> the Miniſters were ſolemnly admitted to their particular miniſtration by their Viſitor, who amogn other things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them their <hi>liber Ritualis,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their form and rites of worſhip, of the performance of which they were to take care, and to which among other offices of their Miniſtry, they did at their Ordination oblige themſelves by a <hi>Religious Oath,</hi> both to God and his Church.<note place="margin">Ratio Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.

Angl.</note> They who entred into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry at <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> after its firſt refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, did by <hi>Oath</hi> undertake to keep in the Communion, and obedience of the Church and its Governours, according to the law of God, and their Canons, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and Ordinances. And it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the laws of <hi>Geneva</hi> (where an eſtabliſhed Liturgy is one of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions) that all they who were there received to the Miniſtry, muſt oblige
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42052:54"/>themſelves by <hi>Oath,</hi> to obſerve the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Ordinances, ordained by the Councils of that City. In the <hi>Hungarian</hi> reformed Church, they who enter the Miniſtry, do by a very <hi>ſolemn Oath</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige themſelves, to the obſervations of the Eccleſiaſtical Canons,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. Augl. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. cap. <hi>31.</hi> in fin.</note> and to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming due obedience to the Biſhop, and other Superiours in the Church, as may be ſeen in their Oath, as it is fully exhibited by Mr. <hi>Durell,</hi> from their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical Conſtitutions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Subſcriptions or Declarations required amongſt us (beſides what for the preſent concerneth the Covenant) are, an acknowledgment of the <hi>Kings juſt authority,</hi> to ſecure the Government; of the <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> to preſerve truth of Doctrine; and of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and Book of <hi>Ordination,</hi> to maintain order and Uniformity: to which end alſo tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Oath of Canonical obedience, wherein ſuch obedience to the Biſhop and his Succeſſors, is engaged in all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and honeſt things: which muſt needs be blameleſs, unleſs it could be accounted a ſin, to reſolve to do good and honeſt things, in a way of order. Of theſe, I ſhall in this diſcourſe treat of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which is chiefly opugned; and therefore requireth the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42052:54"/>principal conſideration, for the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Communion in the worſhip of God, and the manifeſting the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the breach thereof.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Some declared allowance of the Liturgy, hath ſince the reformation been ordinarily required in this Church.<note place="margin">Art. <hi>35.</hi>
                  </note> The <hi>Articles</hi> in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, contained an approbation both of the Book of Common Prayer, and of Ordination. In Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, the allowance of the uſe, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to the Book of Common-Prayer, was required by the <hi>Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>

                  </note> and <hi>Canons,</hi> and defended by Biſhop <hi>Whitgift.</hi> Since Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the ſame hath been performed, in the <hi>Subſcription</hi> according to the <hi>36th</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and in the <hi>Declaration and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,</hi> in the Act of Uniformity, which in ſeenſe much agreeth therewith.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſubſcription required by the thirty ſixth Canon, is grounded upon the Conſtitutions of the Convocation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the authority of the <hi>Kings broad Seal,</hi> according to his ſupream au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Statute, 25. <hi>Henr.</hi> 8. And ſo the Canons of the Church did of old frequently receive a confirmation, by the Emperours ſanction under his Sea; which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42052:55"/>is a thing of ſo great antiquity, that <hi>Euſebius</hi> relateth concerning <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Emperour, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that by his Seal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euſ. de Vit. Conſt. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>27.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſied the determinations made by the Biſhops in their Synods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. That Article in this Canon, which referreth to the Book of Common-Prayer, doth enclude an acknowledging three things. Firſt <hi>that that Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth nothing contrary to the word of God:</hi> which is intended to be manifeſted in the following Chapters, touching the things chiefly oppoſed. The ſecond will be conſequent thereupon, viz. <hi>that it may lawfully be ſo uſed.</hi> The third and laſt clauſe, is a promiſe to <hi>uſe the form pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in that Book, in publick Prayer and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and none other:</hi> the lawfulneſs of which promiſe, doth evidently follow from the former clauſe, and its ſenſe is of the ſame import, with thoſe words of the acknowledgment, required in the Act of Uniformity, viz. <hi>I will conform to the Liturgy of the Church of England, as it is now eſtabliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. But ſome eſpecial doubts have been peculiarly entertained, concerning the ſenſe of the Declaration in the Act of Uniformity, in giving <hi>unfeigned aſſent and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42052:55"/>conſent, to all and every thing, contained and preſcribed, in and by the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer, &amp;c.</hi> But while our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth require the uſe of this form, both the intended ſenſe (being the ſame with that of the two former clauſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Liturgy, in the Canon above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned) and the expreſſion thereof, may upon equitable and impartial conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, appear clearly and fairly juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable. To which purpoſe, the true ſenſe of <hi>aſſenting and conſenting,</hi> and the things to which this hath reſpect, is to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Wherefore it is firſt to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that as to <hi>aſſent,</hi> when referred to things aſſerted, is to owne the truth of them; ſo when referred to things to be done, ordered or uſed, it is to allow that they ſhould be put in practice: in which latter ſenſe, <hi>aſſenting</hi> is one and the ſame with <hi>conſenting.</hi> Now the Act of Uniformity, both immediately before this Declaration, and in divers other places, referreth this unfeigned aſſent and conſent, to <hi>the uſe</hi> of the things in that Book <hi>contained and preſcribed;</hi> and thereby directeth us to this ordinary ſenſe of the word <hi>Aſſent:</hi> as doth alſo the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things to be aſſented to, which for the main part are Prayers, Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42052:56"/>and Rubricks, which being no aſſertions or propoſitions, are to be <hi>uſed,</hi> but not properly to be <hi>believed.</hi> This notion of <hi>aſſenting</hi> in the ſame ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>conſenting,</hi> is according to the frequent uſe of <hi>aſſenſus</hi> in the Latin (as when things are agreed <hi>unanimi aſſenſu &amp; conſenſu,</hi> and the marriage of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is declared,<note place="margin">Littleton C. of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt in Dower.</note> that it ſhould be <hi>de aſſenſu &amp; conſenſu parentum;</hi> and we read of <hi>dower de aſſenſu patris,</hi> in our Engliſh Law-Books) and the ſame might be evidenced by various Engliſh Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. But this Declaration being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by our Statute Laws, it may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to obſerve, that this is a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of the word <hi>aſſent,</hi> in our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Statutes.</p>

In the ſame ſenſe <hi>par aſſent, aſſenſus,</hi> and ſuch like expreſſions, are frequently uſed in our moſt ancient Statutes, in their

                  <hi>by the aſſent and agreement of the perſons,</hi> to whom the reverſion ſhall appertain. Nor doth the uſing theſe two words of <hi>aſſent and conſent,</hi> in the ſame clauſe, require ſuch a ſenſe of this Declaration, in which they muſt differ from each other: ſince variety of words even in the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum acknowledgments, is oft uſed, not to expreſs the difference, but to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the certainty of ſenſe; according to that Rule,<note place="margin">Ex Reg.

               <p n="12">12. And ſince the conſideration both of perſons and time make it evident, that this aſſent to be given, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any thing, to the authoritative
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42052:57"/>ordering and conſtitution of theſe things, (which were before eſtabliſhed by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) its moſt proper and natural ſenſe, muſt import a conſent to, or <hi>allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the uſe</hi> of theſe things, which is the ſenſe, unto which the expreſſions in the Act of Uniformity, do alſo plainly direct. Wherefore ſuch things only as are to be uſed (being both contained and preſcribed) as all the Prayers, Hymns, directing Rubricks, Kalendar, and the Whole frame of the Liturgy, come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of this Declaration. But ſome things occaſionally declared, and not preſcribed, are not contained under it.<note place="margin">In the Preface.</note> For inſtance, theſe words, That <hi>this Book as it ſtood before eſtabliſhed by law, did not contain in it any thing, which a godly man may not with a good Conſcience uſe and ſubmit to;</hi> though they be true and conſiderable, yet if they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded under this Declaration, then even ſuch things as were thought fit to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, muſt be ſtill in ſome ſort aſſented unto; which is both contrary to the end of ſuch alterations, and to the proper ſenſe of the words of this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And even ſuch perſons who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome things or expreſſions preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, either in the Phraſes of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:42052:57"/>it ſelf, or in the <hi>pointing</hi> of the Pſalms, or in the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the Pſalms or other Scriptures; not to be ſuitable to their own deſires or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions (yet to be free from fin, and of ſuch a nature, as that the whole remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth uſeful, to guide the exerciſes of Piety) thoſe perſons may ſafely and with a good Conſcience, make this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>aſſent,</hi> with reſpect unto other weighty conſiderations, of ſubmiſſion to Authority, promoting Peace, Order, and Unity, and the edification of the Church, in the united exerciſe of a right religious worſhip. Even as ſuch learned men, who may judge even our laſt <hi>tranſlation of the Bible,</hi> not to have fitly expreſſed the ſenſe of ſome difficult places, may yet both unfeignedly aſſent, and earneſtly perſwade to the diligent uſe thereof, as knowing it to be of excellent advantage, to the pious and humble Readers, for their profitable learning the Goſpel Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the will of God.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Wherefore by this Declaration is given ſuch an open vocal approbation of this Book, required by Law, as agreeth in ſenſe with the ſubſcription enjoined by Canon.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>P<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>blick Prayer</hi> is acknowledged by all Chriſtians, to be a chief part of the worſhip of God, who hath ſaid, <hi>My houſe ſhall be called an houſe of Prayer for all people.</hi> But ſince God hath not expreſly declared in his word, whether the ordinary publick duties of Chriſtian Prayer, ſhould be performed with or without a form, the determination of the ſitteſt practice in this caſe muſt be made (not without regard to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Governours</hi>) by a reſpect to the rules of <hi>order, edification,</hi> and the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and an eye unto approved exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, from which conſiderations, I ſhall produce divers evidences, of the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiteneſs of a ſet form for the publick of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Church, both from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and from <hi>example</hi> and authority.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The reaſons are ſuch as theſe. 1. That hereby a fit, true, right, and well <hi>ordered way of worſhip,</hi> in addreſſes to God, may be beſt ſecured to the Church, in its publick ſervice of God, that neigher God nor his worſhip may be diſhonoured; their being many eaſily diſcernable ways, of conſiderable miſcarriage, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick offices of the Church, even by them who err not in the doctrines of Religion. 2. That needful <hi>comprehenſive petitions,</hi> for all common and ordinary ſpiritual and outward wants, of our ſelves or others, with fit thankſgivings, may not in the publick ſupplications of the Church be omitted; which (conſidering men as they are) can no other way be either ſo well or at all aſſured. 3. That the <hi>affections and hearts</hi> of pious and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men may be more <hi>devont,</hi> and better <hi>united</hi> in their preſenting their ſervice to God, where they may conſider before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, what particular Prayers and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings they are to offer up, and come the more ready and prepared to join in them. This is an advantage of which many are deprived by a bad temper of mind, either <hi>ſucked</hi> in by <hi>prejudice,</hi> or <hi>ſwallowed down</hi> by <hi>careleſsneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. 4. That ſuch <hi>difficult parts of Church Offices,</hi> as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:42052:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>the matter of which requireth great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that they may be clearly and aright expreſſed, (as both <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> and many <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> acknowledge, and is evident from the many diſputes about them, by men neither of mean parts, nor dangerous deſigns) may by a more <hi>conſiderate</hi> care in the compoſure of a <hi>form,</hi> be ſo framed, that men of greateſt underſtandings may with readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aſſent entertain them, and that they may be ſufficiently vindicated againſt the boldeſt oppoſers. 5. To be an <hi>evidence</hi> to <hi>other Churches and future times,</hi> after what way and manner we worſhip God, and that both the matter and expreſſion of our ſervice to him, is ſound and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in our general and common wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And this may be a full teſtimony that ſuch a Church both receiving the true faith, and expreſſing a right way of worſhip, is both a <hi>true</hi> and in its meaſure a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>incorrupt Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Arguments from <hi>example,</hi> which in general countenance the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or expediency of a form are two, which will require a larger Declaration. The firſt is from the <hi>practice and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt,</hi> who directed his Diſciples the uſe of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> as a ſet form: and that from thence the cuſtom of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42052:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>Chriſtian Church,<note place="margin">De Eccleſ. Offic. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi>

And it may be ſufficiently proved. 1. From the command given by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2. <hi>When ye pray, ſay Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> and the expreſſion in S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Mat,</hi> 6.9. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42052:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the words of S. <hi>Luke</hi> now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, it is not to be doubted, but that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, according to the cuſtom of the Jews, delivered a form of Prayer to his Diſciples, and that what <hi>John</hi> did herein, was both approved, and the like practiſed by our Saviour, who directed the uſe of the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at two different times.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. 3. From the manner of the <hi>compoſure of the Lords Prayer,</hi> which is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as a general direction to pray, that Gods name may be hallowed, and that his Kingdom ſhould come; but it is dictated by Chriſt as it ſhould be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by us in our perſons, <hi>Our father, hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed be thy name, &amp;c.</hi> 4. The ancient <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> near the times of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did acknowledge and uſe it as a <hi>form.</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is very large to this purpoſe;<note place="margin">Cyp. de O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.

Tertullian</hi> before

                     <hi>Chriſtus novam orationis formam determinavit, Chriſt appointed a new form of prayer,</hi> and he ſaith, that whilſt the Chriſtians uſed other Prayers this was not omitted, <hi>praemiſſa legitima &amp; ordinaria oratione quaſi fundamento.</hi> And before both theſe the words of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s time,<note place="margin">Lucian. in Philopat.</note> about reciting the Prayer beginning <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate the ordinary uſe of this Prayer among Chriſtians. From theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies I ſuppoſe it evident, that the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> was uſed as a form in the ancient Chriſtian Aſſemblies, and that we have good reaſon thus far to receive, what ſome hundred years after was delivered by S. <hi>Gregory,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gr. Ep. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>63.</hi>
                     </note> and from him by divers other Writers, that the <hi>Apoſtles themſelves did always at the Conſecration of the Euchariſt, make uſe of the Lords Prayer.</hi> Wherefore the Lords Prayer being thus delivered as a form, doth enclude an approbation of the like compoſures of Prayers among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and an allowance of the ſame among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for whom this was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And that path where we follow our Saviours ſteps cannot be the way of errour.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The other argument from exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is from the ordinary <hi>practice of the Church both Jewiſh and Chriſtian.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42052:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Jewiſh Church, I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the eighteen Prayers, compoſed for its ordinary uſe from the time of the Captivity, which are oft mentioned by the Jewiſh Writers, and in their forms of Prayer for the Paſsover,<note place="margin">De Emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por. l. <hi>6.</hi> p. <hi>573.</hi>
                     </note> of which <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> thinketh that there is as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be confident, <hi>that the particular Prayers recorded in the Talmud</hi> (which he calleth their Digeſts) <hi>were the ancient forms uſed by the Jews, as that the Roman Digeſts exhibit to us the true determination of the Roman Lawyers.</hi> But I ſhall rather inſiſt on the Jewiſh Church making uſe of ſet forms of Prayer, from the very times of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo downwards; which is no new opinion but is ordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and it hath been obſerved by divers learned men, that the <hi>Samaritan Chronicle</hi> ſpeaketh of a <hi>Book of Prayers, uſed by the Jews at their Sacrifices, from the time of their Legate</hi> Moſes, <hi>until that day.</hi> And beſides the teſtimony of that Author (which I urge no further than other proof may be made) let theſe two things be conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Firſt, That it is certain from the Scriptures (and oft expreſſed by <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi>) that the Jews did uſe Prayers with their Sacrifices and oblations. <hi>The whole multitude were praying without at

Which was the time of the evening Sacrifice;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> Mede Diſc. on Ezr. <hi>6.10.</hi>
                     </note> and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath well proved that Sacrifice if ſelf is a rite of ſupplication. And that the uſe of ſuch Prayers was as ancient as <hi>Moſes,</hi> is manifeſt from <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.21. Where <hi>Aaron</hi> was commanded <hi>to confeſs over the live Goat, the iniquities of the Children of Iſrael.</hi> Secondly, That there are plain eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Old Teſtament, of ſuch forms uſed upon many occaſions. Beſides the forms of Prayers and praiſes in the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> enjoined for conſtant uſe unto the Levites by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and the Princes, 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 29, 30. and beſides divers other Hymns and Songs, and ſuch commands for a form of words, as <hi>Joel</hi> 2.17. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. there is an <hi>expreſs form of Prayer</hi> appointed by God, to be uſed at the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Heifer for expiation of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain murder, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.21. and a <hi>form of confeſſion</hi> at the offering up their firſt fruits, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. and a form of <hi>Prayer at the preſenting</hi> the third years Tithe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.13, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſome other ſuch like. Whence it is evident, that forms of Prayer were by <hi>Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment</hi> uſed, from the beginning of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42052:62"/>Jewiſh Church. Yet if no ſuch thing could have been proved, and if their original had been from <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and the direction of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> this alone might be ſufficient to recommend them unto Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In conſidering the general practice of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that in that extraordinary caſe (which reacheth not the ordinary condition of the Church) when the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt were communicated; both <hi>Prayer, propheſying, and ſinging</hi> were frequently thereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as is evident from 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. And I yield it moſt probable (though even Proteſtant Writers do herein differ) that the ancient <hi>Roman, Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Alexandrian Offices,</hi> were called the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies of</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>James,</hi> and S. <hi>Mark,</hi> becauſe of their certain early uſe in the Churches where they preſided; though it is not certain that they were compoſed by them, this being mentioned by no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writer of the firſt Centuries. Nor do I doubt but the <hi>Liturgy or Anaphora of S.

                  <p n="9">9. That <hi>forms of Prayer</hi> were of uſe in the Church, about 1300 years ſince, is acknowledged by them who plead moſt againſt them, from <hi>Conc. Laod. c.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Carth. c.</hi> 23. <hi>and Conc. Mil. c.</hi> 12. and that they have continued from that time downward, cannot be denied. In the <hi>fourth Century,</hi> there is frequent mention in ſome parcels of Liturgy, in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Fathers: and there are ſo many teſtimonies that S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and S. <hi>Baſil</hi> were framers of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, that I do not ſee how any can rationally doubt of the truth thereof.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42052:63"/>But that theſe Liturgies have undergone divers alterations in ſucceeding Ages, is both apparent, and is very reaſonable to be imagined. And he who ſhall compare the <hi>Greek</hi> Copy of S. <hi>Baſils Liturgy,</hi> with the <hi>Syriack</hi> or its verſion, both which are repreſented together by <hi>Caſſander,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Caſſand.

But from theſe I ſhall now look back, into the <hi>more early times of the Chriſtian Church,</hi> where for the moſt part, I ſhall only briefly mention the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, which have been fully produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by others.</p>

                  <p n="9">9. The argument againſt the <hi>lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of ſet forms, becauſe they <hi>limit the uſe of gifts,</hi> needeth not much conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſince it is manifeſt, that by the will of God, bounds and limits were to be ſet even to the uſe of the <hi>extraordinary gifts of Gods ſpirit,</hi> that the Church might be edifyed. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26, 27, 28, 30, 33. Whereas now no ſuch miraculous <hi>emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> can be pretended; nor doth the eſtabliſhing a form for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices of the Church deny the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in due place of uſing other Prayers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the practice of our and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. It is further objected, that forms of Prayer are <hi>diſadvantageous to piety</hi> and <hi>devotion,</hi> and the Non-Conformiſts oft plead experience as a teſtimony, that they are the cauſe of much <hi>deadneſs in mens ſpirits,</hi> and the hindrance of the lively exerciſe of Religion. Here on
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42052:70"/>the other hand, others by experience aſſert the advantage of ſet forms to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote devotion,</hi> when attended without prejudice, and with a Religious deſign of joining in Gods worſhip.

But the ſureſt way of tryal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by forms of Prayer may be manifeſted to bring no diſadvantage to the Church of themſelves, is from conſidering ſeveral arguments to that purpoſe, as 1. becauſe (as I have ſhewed) God himſelf <hi>preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed a conſtant form</hi> of Prayer for the Jewiſh Offrings, and a form of Prieſtly bleſſing; and our Saviour directed the Lords Prayer as a form, and preſented a form of words for the <hi>adminiſtring Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm:</hi> but it muſt be at the leaſt a great miſapprehenſion and ſin, to think that the holy God and our bleſſed Saviour, ſhould <hi>command and enjoin</hi> what is of its own nature <hi>a hindrance to godlineſs,</hi> Piety and true Religion, and a diſadvantage to the Church.<note place="margin">De Orat. Dom.</note> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaid well, <hi>what Prayer can be more ſpiritual than that which was given to us by Chriſt, by whom the holy Spirit himſelf was ſent?</hi> 2. Becauſe it is generally acknowledged that the <hi>ſinging Pſalms of Prayer or praiſe,</hi> may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly performed in a ſet form of words, and the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> are not the leſs edifying nor the leſs applicable to our
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42052:71"/>ſelves becauſe they are contained in a ſet form of words, &amp; both in reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and in Prayer our hearts ought to be religiouſly moved towards God though in ſomewhat a different manner. 3. Becauſe all the <hi>ages of the Chriſtian Church from the firſt Centuries,</hi> have uſed them as an <hi>advantage to Religion;</hi> and it is not at all probable, that ſuch excellently devout and judicious men, as the fourth and fifth Centuries abounded with, ſhould be ſo <hi>ſtupid and dull ſpirited,</hi> as not any of them to diſcern between the <hi>helps and hindrances of religious devotion,</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of moſt ordinary practice. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though many mens minds may be moſt pleaſed and delighted with variety of expreſſion, there is no <hi>prejudice</hi> to <hi>piety</hi> from a ſet form, further than this is cauſed by prejudice againſt ſuch a form, or by want of a <hi>Religious temper</hi> to join in it.

                  <p n="1">1. Coming now to a particular conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of that <hi>form of Prayer</hi> enjoined in this Church, I ſhall wave ſuch things where the force and matter of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections is cut of, by the alterations au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively made in the new eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our <hi>Liturgy;</hi> and beginning with the Prayers themſelves in the daily ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, there are two things eſpecially to be treated of concerning their general frame and contexture. The <hi>firſt</hi> is that the people are required to bear a part in this ſervice, not only in that they are by voice to join in the <hi>Confeſſion and Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> but that ſeveral Petitions are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be expreſſed, by the united voice of all the Aſſembly. This is condemned by the Non-Conformiſts,<note place="margin">Except of Presbyter p. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> who ſay that the <hi>Miniſter is appointed for the people, in all publick ſervices appertaining to God,</hi> and that the <hi>people hereby ſeem to invade that ſacred office; the Scriptures making the Miniſter the mouth of the people to God in Prayer, and intimating the peoples part to be only to ſay,</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:42052:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſince our Saviour condemneth the <hi>teaching, or receiving for doctrines the commandments of men;</hi> we may not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that as a Scripture doctrine, where the Scripture delivereth no ſuch thing. Indeed under the law there was a ſpecial command of God, that whatever legal Sacrifices were offered to him (ſome few extraordinary caſes only excepted) that ſervice was to be performed by the hand of the Prieſt; but there is no conſtitution under the Goſpel, that ſpiritual <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Prayer, thanksgiving,</hi> or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a <hi>contrite broken heart,</hi> may be offered up to God in no other way than by the mouth of a Miniſter, though it be in a publick Aſſembly. And what they aſſert is (ſufficiently to other mens underſtandings) contradicted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who allow the people liberty by their voices to join in <hi>ſinging thoſe Pſalms</hi> which contain both Prayers, praiſes, and Confeſſions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The truth is, all ſuch Prayers as have particular reference to the <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to the <hi>Miniſterial abſolution and benediction,</hi> ought to be performed by the Miniſter alone (though it be in a private place, and upon a particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) becauſe theſe things enclude the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42052:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>power of the Keys.</hi> But as for others the rules of order and edification will direct, that Prayers and Confeſſions which are conſiderably long ſhould be expreſſed by one, that the reſt may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and join in them; and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Eccleſiaſtical office, and its order and degree in the Church, will require this to be performed by ſome in the Miniſtry. For this we have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Scripture times, to which agreeth the practice of the following ages;<note place="margin">De Eccleſ. Dogm. c. <hi>30.</hi>
                     </note> and the author under S. <hi>Aug.</hi> name ſaith, that <hi>thoſe who are of authority in the Church, tota fere Eccleſia ſecum congemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente poſtulant &amp; precantur, do put up their requeſts and Prayers almoſt all the Church joining with their ſighs and groans.</hi> Yet this practice doth no way diſallow the peoples vocal joining, in ſhort Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or in other generally known Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſince this may be of good uſe to <hi>unite their affections</hi> more firmly, to <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their minds</hi> into a greater fervency, and to <hi>fix their ſpirits</hi> in a more diligent attending to the ſervice they are about, and more particularly to <hi>expreſs their joining therein,</hi> whereby they may both incite others, and uſe their tongues as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Gods glory.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Indeed S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>him who
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42052:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>occupieth the room of the unlearned, ſaying Amen, at their bleſſing or giving of thanks.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16. But the very phraſe of bleſſing and giving of thanks, makes it probable that this Text is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> expoundeth it, of the Conſecration of the Communion. And at that time the people did ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily anſwer <hi>Amen,</hi> and nothing more, as appeareth from the early teſtimonies of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius Biſhop of Alexandria.</hi> 2. But if this ſenſe be not admitted, this Text of the Apoſtle doth neither mention, nor in the context more nearly refer to Prayer than to ſinging, in which latter the peoples bare ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> is not contended for, nor allowed as a conſtant rule for the Churches pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, though it was probable the uſual method in the Chriſtian Aſſemblies in thoſe <hi>Apoſtolical days,</hi> when the duty of ſinging was performed by the immediate inſpiration of the ſpirit, upon ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons: and that theſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary motions of Gods ſpirit in thoſe times, were only vouchſafed <hi>to the Clergy or Miniſtry,</hi> is not probable from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of that very Chapter. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this place of Scripture doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the whole vocal ſervice of God (excepting an <hi>Amen</hi>) to the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:42052:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>the people being altogether debarred and excluded.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But that all the ſervants of God may allowably be intereſted, (where the due rules of order and edification are obſerved) in the outward <hi>joint expreſſion of praiſe and Prayer to God,</hi> is very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the holy Scriptures, where the holy Angels are repreſented to <hi>cry one to another and ſay, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hoſts, the whole Earth is full of his glory, Iſ</hi> 6.3. and <hi>all Iſrael praiſed God and ſaid, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 2.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42052:77"/>the <hi>merits of Chriſt</hi> are often mentioned in the end thereof, as the only way and means of our acceſs to God, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining grace and help from him; with a more frequent ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of confidence and joint conſent in theſe Prayers. Since therefore the ſerious <hi>ſenſe of God,</hi> and an application to him, and confidence in him, with an eye to the <hi>merits of Chriſt,</hi> ought to take place in our minds throughout every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition in our Prayer; I cannot ſee how the vocal expreſſing them if <hi>ſolemnly</hi> performed, and not beyond what is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and convenient,</hi> can poſſibly fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any juſt cenſure, unleſs it could be ſinful to expreſs that with the mouth in publick ſervice, which is both pious and requiſite to be conceived in the heart: eſpecially ſince it cannot be denied, but that <hi>God is honoured</hi> by us if we think of him frequently, provided it be alſo piouſly; and no imaginable account can be given, why he ſhould not be alſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by us when we oft <hi>expreſs his name</hi> in Religious invocation of him, but not without a due <hi>gravity, reverent devoutneſs,</hi> and <hi>pious affection.</hi>

Divers Prayers recorded in the holy Scriptures, which were either directed for the uſe of, or declared to have been uſed in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies, were <hi>ſhort Prayers,</hi> ſuch beſides the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> was the Prayer of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> referring to the <hi>Paſsover.</hi> 2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 30.18, 19. the <hi>Prayer of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> directed for the Temple ſervice, <hi>Joel,</hi> 2.17, 18. and that of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2, 3. and the time of theſe ſolemnities being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it cannot in reaſon be doubted, but that they uſed other Prayers beſides theſe, at the ſame time. 3.

Wherefore ſince this is of <hi>ſo ancient original</hi> in the Chriſtian Church, ſo agreeable to the practice of the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> approved by the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and a practice ſo reaſonable in it ſelf, it may be <hi>piouſly uſed,</hi> but not juſtly blamed in our Liturgy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reading the <hi>Athanaſian Creed,</hi> to ſome (though not the generality of Non-Conformiſts) who heartily owne the doctrine of the Trinity, hath been thought a matter not free from difficulty. For that Creed expreſſing, what muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved of every one who would be ſaved, doth contain deep myſteries (as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.) <hi>that the Son is not made nor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but begotten,</hi> and <hi>that the Holy Ghoſt is neither made nor created nor begotten, but proceeding.</hi> Now ſince believing things as neceſſary to Salvation, is not an aſſent to the uſe of Phraſes and expreſſions, but to the ſenſe contained in them, it muſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42052:83"/>enclude that there is ſome difference underſtood between what is <hi>affirmed</hi> and what is <hi>denied.</hi> But the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Eternal <hi>Generation,</hi> and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> being a Myſtery where the greateſt Divines ſee but <hi>darkly,</hi> they are juſtly affraid to condemn all perſons as uncapable of Salvation, who cannot reach to ſo <hi>high a pitch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But here it is to be conſidered, that in that Creed commonly called the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſian,</hi> there are ſome things contained and expreſſed as <hi>neceſſary points of Faith;</hi> and other things for a more clear and uſeful explication of the truth, though they be not of equal neceſſity to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, adn believed even by the meaneſt capacities. Thus if we firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the contexture of that Creed, the Faith declared neceſſary concerning the Trinity, is thus expreſſed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, <hi>The Catholick Faith is this, that we worſhip one God in Trinity, and Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, neither confounding the perſons, nor dividing the ſubſtance.</hi> After this followeth an explication, uſeful to ſet forth the true Chriſtian Doctrine, which beginneth, <hi>For there is one perſon of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> after which explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſame neceſſary doctine to be known and believed, is thus again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42052:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>preſſed, and diſtinguiſhed from that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> in theſe words, <hi>So that in all things as is aforeſaid, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in Trinity, and Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity is to be worſhipped, he therefore who will be ſaved muſt thus think of the Trinity.</hi> So that the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging and worſhipping the <hi>Trinity of perſons,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Godhead,</hi> is that which only is declared neceſſary in the former part of that Creed; and this muſt be acknowledged neceſſary, ſince we are baptized into the name of the <hi>Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and we muſt <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and worſhip</hi> according as we are <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. What is contained in this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the more clear (both with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the inſtance mentioned, and to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the two natures in Chriſt,</hi>) by this following obſervation: <hi>viz.</hi> That our Church doth both here and in her Articles, evidently receive the <hi>Athanaſian Creed:</hi> and yet from the manner of uſing the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> in the <hi>form of Baptiſin,</hi> as containing the profeſſion of that Faith into which we are baptized; <hi>in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi> as containing all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith; and in the <hi>Viſitation of the ſick,</hi> as being a rule to try whether he believe as a Chriſtian man ſhould or not; it is manifeſt that no more is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42052:84"/>in our Church, of <hi>neceſſity to ſalvation</hi> for all men to believe, than that only which is contained and expreſſed in the <hi>Apoſtles Creed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. I proceed to conſider ſome expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the <hi>Litany.</hi> In the way to which I ſhall only reflect upon that objection, (which if it had not been miſtaken had been very inconſiderable) framed by Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> againſt the Litany in General; That it being chiefly a deprecatory Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er againſt evils was framed by <hi>Mamertus Biſhop of Vienna</hi> (or rather <hi>Vienne in France</hi>) upon a ſpecial occaſion of the calamities of that Country. This was a very ſtrange and groſs miſtake, for the <hi>Litaniae</hi> which were ordered by <hi>Mamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> were days of ſupplication in <hi>Rogation Week,</hi> which days were called <hi>Litania minor, triduanae Litaniae,</hi> and by ſome <hi>Litania major,</hi>

But that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precatory
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42052:84"/>Prayers which are called Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies alſo, and were ſo called by S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and were of ſo great uſe in the <hi>ſtationary days</hi> of the ancient Church, ſhould have their original from <hi>Mimertus,</hi> who lived many hundred years after, is a notion built upon no other foundation, but the manifeſt miſ-apprehending the ſenſe of that word <hi>Litania.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Amongſt the particular expreſſions in the Litany, diſliked by many Non-Conformiſts the firſt is where we pray to be delivered <hi>from fornication, and all other deadly ſin.</hi> But the phraſe of deadly ſin is ſufficiently warranted from theſe places of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſin is death.</hi> Jam. 1.15. <hi>Sin when it hath conceived bringeth forth death.</hi> Jam. 3.8. <hi>The tongue is full of deadly poiſon.</hi> And the ſenſe of this phraſe in this place is this, that we here pray to be kept from all ſuch ſins as are moſt deſtructive and pernicious (which is all one with deadly) and to be delivered from all ſin (the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all fin encluding a tendency to death) and this extenſive ſenſe of this phraſe, is both ſuitable to the pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of a Chriſtian, and agreeable to the comprehenſiveneſs of the following words, <hi>From all the deceits of the World, the fleſh and the Devil, Good Lord deliver us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:42052:85"/>
                  <p n="7">7. That Petition againſt <hi>ſudden death,</hi> hath alſo been much excepted againſt, and <hi>Druſius</hi> ſeemed to have an eye to this,<note place="margin">Druſ. in Job. <hi>21.13.</hi>
                     </note> writing upon that expreſſion in <hi>Job,</hi> concerning the wicked, <hi>They ſpend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave;</hi> that is (ſaith he) they dye <hi>cita morte quam aliqui deprecantur, ſed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derint an recte.</hi> But if that learned man had any deſign from this text to cenſure this <hi>Prayer of our Liturgy,</hi> he hath greatly miſcarried in his attempt. For if he with others be right in the expoſition of that phraſe (which may well be underſtood that the life of the wicked was <hi>ſo proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that it ſeemed not to them tedious and long</hi>) I ſay if his ſenſe be embraced, theſe words cannot be allowed to contain ſuch bleſſings, as were really advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the wicked, and truly deſireable for him; but only ſuch things at the beſt, as appeared good to them who have their eye no farther than the things of this life; unleſs his being <hi>in a moment cut off from all hopes of the time of grace and repentance,</hi> could be a bleſſing.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I doubt not but the intent of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt <hi>ſudden death,</hi> is this, that whereas many dangers might daily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize us, and by a ſudden ſtroke end our lives, if divine providence did not protect
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42052:85"/>us, we here commit our ſelves to Gods keeping, to be <hi>preſerved by his care</hi> from ſuch judgments and dangers. And ſuch a ſudden death is a dreadful eſtate to the wicked, and to dye as <hi>Joſiah</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> did, is not deſirable to the moſt holy and pious men, who according to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Jacob, David,</hi> and our bleſſed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> himſelf, by their holy inſtructions at the time of their death, may become uſeful for the bettering the lives of them who ſurvive.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But they tell us, there may be <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death in a lawful War or Martyrdom,</hi> To which I anſwer. 1. That ſudden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected death is chiefly intended in this <hi>Prayer,</hi> and in this ſenſe <hi>Martyrdom</hi> is not always a ſudden death. 2. That the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Saviour, who prayed with ſubmiſſion to his Fathers will, that <hi>that Cup might paſs from him,</hi> will warrant the like ſubmiſſive Prayer in any of his Diſciples. 3. And chiefly it is upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers accounts both <hi>lawful and fit,</hi> to pray that we may not be ſuddenly taken away, either by <hi>Martyrdom or War.</hi> For though Chriſtianity tendeth to prepare men to be willing and ready, upon juſt occaſions to hazard or lay down their lives; yet <hi>touching Martyrdom,</hi> true Chriſtian charity towards all men, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42052:86"/>love to the Church of God, will direct us to pray, that the truth of God may ever be ſo <hi>countenanced</hi> in the World (if God ſee it good) and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially amongſt us, that the Church of God may be free from perſecution, and that none in the World may be ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to <hi>oppoſe Religion,</hi> with deſign to take away the lives of its Profeſſors; and that the true members of the Church of God may be preſerved from ſuch <hi>cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> as were exerciſed in divers horrid meaſures, and were deſigned in the <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-treaſon.</hi> And ſo far as concerneth <hi>ſudden death in lawful Wars,</hi> the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the doctrine of Chriſtianity, will not only allow bt excite us to pray, that righteouſneſs and love may ſo far <hi>prevail</hi> in the World, that none may through any <hi>injuſtice, pride,</hi> or <hi>inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affections promote Wars,</hi> and that Swords may be turned into Plow-ſhares rather than ſheathed in one anothers bowells.</p>
                  <p n="10">10.

                  <p n="1">1. Among the particular Objections from the matter of theſe books.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 1. <hi>Judith, Suſanna, Bel and the Dragon are thought to be ſabulous, becauſe no certain time can be eaſily fixed for Judith, S. Hierome calleth the other ſuſannae Belis &amp; Draconis fabulas,</hi>

                     <hi>and</hi> Joſephus <hi>maketh no mention of them.</hi> But firſt, if theſe Books ſhould be admitted to be <hi>parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical diſcourſes,</hi> to expreſs the great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of many wicked men againſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42052:92"/>God, and his Worſhip, the Vanity and Folly of their Pride and evil deſigns, and the mighty protection that God can give to his people by his Almighty Power, they might ſtill be <hi>allowed</hi> to be of very conſiderable uſe. The frequent uſe of Parabolical Inſtructions among the Jews, is both manifeſt from their Talmudical Writers, and allowed by the practice of our Saviur. And beſides this, they had another Cuſtom of <hi>Clothing real Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> under different names which expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a reſemblance of the things intended:<note place="margin">Targ. in Cant. c. <hi>6.</hi> v. <hi>7, 8.</hi>
                     </note> whence the <hi>Targum</hi> mentioning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt <hi>Antiochus,</hi> ſpeaketh of him under th ename of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the Prophet ſpeaketh to the Jews under the ſtile of <hi>the Rulers of</hi> Sodom <hi>and the Elders of</hi> Gomorrha.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And ſecondly the Objection is not ſufficient to diſprove the <hi>Hiſtorical truth</hi> of theſe Books, if we conſider, 1. That the fixed time of the life of <hi>Job,</hi> and the time to which divers Prophecies refer is not eaſily determined, which yet is no good argument againſt the truth of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as it is a bad argument againſt the credit of ancient Hiſtory, either of our own or other Nations, that it is hard to fix the ſcituation of divets <hi>ancient pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> mentioned by names now <hi>unknown.</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:42052:93"/>2. That both <hi>Joſephus</hi> and other Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, do make no mention of divers conſiderable things, which were certainly true, as for <hi>Joſephus,</hi> ſome of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the matter of divers Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Books, and ſome remarkable Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as particularly all that referred to the framing the <hi>Golden Calf</hi> are omitted by him. 3. That the ancient Chriſtians who had the uſe of divers ancient <hi>Jewiſh Writers,</hi> and other Hiſtonary now loſt, and had thereby greater opportunity of ſearching into the Hiſtorical truth of theſe things, did eſteem them to be true Relations. <hi>Bel and the Dragon</hi> is cited as a true Narration, containing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for Martyrdom, and an inſtance of the ſureneſs of Gods proviſion for them that truſt in him, by <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus, S.

                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:42052:113"/>is a very great Chriſtian duty, and cannot be neglected without grievous ſin and the diſpleaſure of God. This may appear, by obſerving that God ſtrictly required all his Sacramental Inſtitutions to be received; when he appointed Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, he declareth concerning the uncircumciſed Manchild, that <hi>that Soul ſhould be cut of from his people, he hath broken my Covenant, Gen.</hi> 17.14. When he ordered the uſe of the Paſs-over, he ſaid <hi>the man that is clean, and not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the ſame ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people, becauſe he brought not the Offring of the Lord in his appointed ſeaſon; that man ſhall bear his ſin.

Now the reaſon why God was ſo greatly offended, at the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of theſe Sacraments, is expreſſed to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42052:113"/>be, becauſe he accounted this to be a diſowning or diſ-eſteeming his <hi>Covenant,</hi> of which his Sacraments were a ſign and ſeal. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14. and becauſe Gods <hi>appointment</hi> and inſtitution therein was not obeyed, <hi>Num.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.30. Wherefore becauſe the Lords Supper doth exhibit the <hi>New Teſtament in the blood of Chriſt,</hi> and the partaking thereof is particularly <hi>commanded</hi> by Chriſt, it muſt upon the ſame reaſons be as evil and dangerous to neglect this Sacrament, as thoſe other.

                  <p n="6">6. I proceed now more briefly, to the conſideration of the words, which our Saviour ſpoke at the diſtribution of this
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42052:121"/>Sacrament. Now theſe words of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Take, eat,</hi> in S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark; drink ye all of it</hi> in S.

Yet conſidering that theſe holy Pen-men did in ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the inſtitution of Chriſt, ſufficiently delivering what was neceſſary for us, but not <hi>confining themſelves to the very words he ſpake,</hi> but to the ſenſe thereof, (which is manifeſt becauſe they all four, relate his words ſpoken at the diſtribution, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently from one another) the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts expreſſions, may well conſiſt with his <hi>ſpeaking particularly</hi> to every perſon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what is ſpoken <hi>to every one,</hi> may be briefly and ſuccinctly related as ſpoken <hi>to them all.</hi> And though this be not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain (which yet is the more probable from the evidence above given, of the particular diſtribution of the Sacramental Elements, to every Communicant) let them who manage this Objection conſider with themſelves, whether they would <hi>grant</hi> that in other Caſes, which they <hi>plead for</hi> in this. We read that when our Lord gave full Commiſſion to his Apoſtles, he
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42052:122"/>ſaid to them, <hi>Jo.</hi> 20.21, 22, 23. <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend</hi> I you, <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt.

And if the <hi>baptiſmal form of words,</hi> may be ſolemnly and ſuitably to that Sacrament, applyed to every perſon baptized, by the general acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Chriſtians, there can be no reaſon why the like may not be allowed in the Lords Supper.

                  <p n="1">1. THE next Office in the Book of Common Prayer is that of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,</hi> where that which requireth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal conſideration, is that every baptized Infant is declared <hi>Regenerate,</hi> and thanks is returned to God (after Baptiſm) <hi>that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42052:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>he hath regenerated this Infant by his holy Spirit,</hi> and the beginning of the Catechiſm declareth, that the Child in <hi>Baptiſm was made a Member of Chriſt, a Child of God, and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Theſe expreſſions have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differently underſtood, ſome apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to a <hi>ſaving Regeneration</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry baptized Infant, others to a <hi>federal Regeneration,</hi> or a <hi>Regeneration Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tenus.</hi> And I ſuppoſe it evident, that if it can be certainly proved, that every baptized Infant is <hi>ſavingly</hi> regenerated, or if on the other ſide all the expreſſions in the Liturgy can be fairly and probably interpreted of a <hi>federal</hi> Regeneration, which is generally acknowledged, there can be then no doubt but all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions may be fitly and allowably uſed ſhall treat of both theſe ſenſes, becauſe they both plead <hi>an allowance in our Church;</hi> and indeed the latter doth not neceſſarily deſtroy, but may well conſiſt with the former.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beginning with the former, I ſhall firſt ſhew what evidence there is, that the acknowledging <hi>a ſaving regeneration of every Infant baptized,</hi> hath been the Doctrine publickly received in this Church, ever ſince the Reformation.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42052:125"/>before the Catechiſm,</hi> in the former Book of Common Prayer, and <hi>that at the end of Baptiſm</hi> in the preſent Book, both which declare, that <hi>Children baptized are undoubtedly ſaved;</hi> that is (as the firſt Book of <hi>Edw.</hi> VI. and our preſent Book do expreſs it) <hi>if they dye in their infancy, and before they commit actual ſin.</hi> And our Book of Homilies declareth,<note place="margin">Hem. of Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by Chriſt, Part. <hi>1.</hi>

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42052:125"/>Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> thus, <hi>We confeſs and have evermore taught, that in the Sacrament of Baptiſm, by the death and blood of Chriſt, is given remiſſion of all manner of ſin, and that not in half or in part, or by way of imagination or by ſancy; but whole, full, and perfect of all together, ſo that now was S.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, There is no condemnation to them that be in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But it muſt be here noted, that by the <hi>ſaving regeneration</hi> of baptized Infants, it is not intended that their underſtandings or wills are guided to an high eſteem and love of God and the Chriſtian life, which the Infant ſtate is not capable of: but this regeneration is mainly <hi>relative,</hi> ſo that being regenerated by Baptiſm, they are no longer the Children of wrath, and under the curſe due to original ſin; but are brought into a new ſtate, to be <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body of Chriſt,</hi> and thereby par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the favour of God. And though ſome ſmall ſeeds of <hi>gracious diſpoſition</hi> may be in Infants, who are capable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the ſame manner as they are of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; yet that <hi>regeneration or renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of an Infant in Baptiſm, whereby he is received into a ſtate of remiſſion and Salvation, is very different from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of an adult perſon, whereby

And it muſt needs be the work of God and of his <hi>Grace,</hi> to accept an Infant born under Original ſin into his favour, or as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expreſſeth it:<note place="margin">Aug.

                     <hi>By the grace of God, the guilt of all ſins that are paſt, is pardoned in them who are baptized into Chriſt, which is done by the Spirit of Regeneration;</hi> and <hi>in the Adult their will is cured by the Spirit of Faith and Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now that all baptized Infants are ſavingly regenerated, is aſſerted upon ſuch Arguments as theſe. 1. Becauſe Baptiſm doth evidence every perſon rightly baptized according to Gods will to be <hi>received by the will of God,</hi> to be <hi>under the terms of the Covenant of Grace;</hi> but he who is rightly received to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant of Grace is in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, if the conditions of that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42052:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>Covenant on his part be performed, nor doth any thing exclude him from that favour beſides the ſinning againſt or the breach of thoſe conditions. But <hi>Original ſin</hi> (of which alone Infants are guilty) was ſuppoſed to be the ſtate under which man lay, when the Covenant of Grace was tendered to him, and ſo is no <hi>breach of the conditions of that Covenant,</hi> but may be pardoned by the benefits thereof. And no condition can be aſſigned to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on mans part, by or concerning an <hi>Infant born in the Church,</hi> more than is encluded in its being baptized (which I ſhall further clear when I ſhall treat of the condition of believing which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally propounded) even as the being <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed</hi> was of old the <hi>performing the condition</hi> of Gods Covenant, by the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.7, 10, 11, 12, 14. faith and obedience being alſo neceſſary in perſons adult. But that Baptiſm doth admit the perſon baptized aright, to be under the terms of the Covenant of Grace is manifeſt, becauſe <hi>they are baptized into Chriſts body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. <hi>They are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized into Chriſt, and have put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.27. <hi>And are baptized into the death of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 6.3. and even Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it ſelf was a <hi>ſeal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> Rom. 4.11.</p>

The Goſpel Doctrine and the holy Sacraments do <hi>convey ſaving benefits</hi> to them who received them <hi>aright,</hi> and are partakers of them with <hi>due qualifications.</hi> That Infants born in the Church are fitly qualified to receive Baptiſm, is not only manifeſt from the <hi>general practice</hi> of the Church from the Apoſtles times in bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Infants; but alſo from the <hi>favour of God expreſſed</hi> towards them in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and in that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was <hi>adminiſtred</hi> to Infants, which was a Seal of the Covenant of Grace. And as the Goſpel Doctrine bringeth Salvation to him who rightly receiveth it, and the Lords Supper tendereth Chriſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins to the worthy partakers thereof; ſo even Baptiſm conveyeth ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving benefits to them who receive it with due qualification: hence S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth in the <hi>waſhing of regeneration, by which God ſaved us,</hi> Tit. 3.5. S. <hi>Peter</hi> commanded them who were pricked in their hearts <hi>to repent, and be baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, for the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, Act.</hi> 2.37, 38. and <hi>Ananias</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <hi>Paul</hi> to be <hi>baptized, and waſh away his ſins, Act</hi> 22.16. Which places both ſhew, that Baptiſm doth convey remiſſion of ſins, to them who are qualified aright to receive it, and alſo that they who
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42052:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>were under a due preparation to receive remiſſion of ſins by Baptiſm, were <hi>not partakers</hi> thereof without Baptiſm. And indeed no adult perſon is ordinarily ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of remiſſion, but by joyning inward <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> with <hi>outward Baptiſm,</hi> as is expreſſed, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. Baptiſm being the inſtituted Ordinance wherein they muſt declare repentance in coming to Chriſt, and profeſs faith in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Goſpel and receive gracious Union with Chriſt. Wherefore ſince Baptiſm doth bring the <hi>due receiver</hi> thereof into a <hi>ſaving eſtate;</hi> infants muſt alſo be acknowledged due receivers of Baptiſm, and rightly admitted thereto.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. 3.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42052:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>can admit no more, but that they ſhould be <hi>paſſive recipients,</hi> both of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Now that Baptiſm is deſigned to be a means of Salvation, beſides the Scriptures above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, is expreſſed by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet</hi> 3.21. who ſaith <hi>that Baptiſm now ſaveth us.</hi> And whereas that Apoſtle preſently addeth, that it is <hi>not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, but that anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God;</hi> he doth not thereby look off from the Sacrament of Baptiſm, to ſomething elſe as a means of Salvation; but he thereby declareth, that this Chriſtian Sacrament is not as the <hi>Jewiſh Purifications,</hi> only a putting away the filth of the fleſh, but it is a <hi>profeſſed engaging</hi> of man to God, or to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. 4. If baptized Infants born in the Church be not in their Baptiſm in a ſtate of Salvation, it will be hard to ſhew what <hi>benefit,</hi> any Infant dying in his Infancy, can enjoy thereby. Now to aſſert that they have <hi>no benefit by Baptiſm,</hi> would be to render that Ordinance to them <hi>uſeleſs and of no effect,</hi> which the Scriptures do declare to be of a <hi>ſaving nature;</hi> and to enclude a being <hi>buried with Chriſt, Col.</hi> 2.12. Now if it be ſaid that by Baptiſm
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42052:128"/>they <hi>become members</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage can this be to them, if this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip doth not enclude the favour of God, and a ſtate of Salvation? If it be ſaid that it may be <hi>hoped</hi> that God will <hi>ſave the baptized infant;</hi> this indeed may be hoped with confidence, if Baptiſm bring them into a ſtate of ſalvation; but if Baptiſm (ſuppoſing always the Grace of God tendred therein) do not enſtate them in ſalvation, them muſt they be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only by Gods <hi>extraordinary grace,</hi> not by the <hi>ordinary grace of his promiſe,</hi> to them who embrace aright the means of ſalvation, or by the <hi>grace</hi> of God in the Ordinance of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and therefore this Salvation would not be an advantage ſlowing from their Baptiſm. But if it be ſaid that by Baptiſm the <hi>Covenant of grace is ſealed</hi> to ſuch Infants, we muſt here further conſider, that Gods Covenant by reaſon of his faithfulneſs, goodneſs and Soveraignty cannot be <hi>ſealed</hi> as mens Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants are, to <hi>make it firm and binding,</hi> when it would otherwiſe be void and of no force. Wherefore there remain two ways, whereby the Sacraments as they are on Gods part Seals of the Covenant of Grace, may be of great advantage unto us: the one is, as they give <hi>further aſſurance,</hi> of the priviledges of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42052:129"/>for our comfort; but of this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit theſe infants are not capable, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the receiving this comfort, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the exerciſe of <hi>judgment and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;</hi> and partly becauſe the evident ſureneſs of Gods Covenant, can be no cauſe of <hi>conſolation</hi> to them, unleſs we admit that there is ſome-<hi>ordinary means appointed</hi> of God, whereby they may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the bleſſings ſo aſſured: the other way of advantage is, by the benefits of Gods Covenant being <hi>ſealed, or ſurely conveyed,</hi> as the preſent intereſt and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the perſons, <hi>rightly receiving</hi> theſe Seals, and in this way which enclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſaying regeneration, infants are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed capable of receiving <hi>wonderful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> thereby.</p>

Divers others as <hi>Auguſtine, Bede, Hugo de Victore.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42052:134"/>is capable of, which is <hi>Paſſively.</hi> Thus by <hi>being baptized he accepteth Chriſt,</hi> and the Covenant of Grace, being united to and made a Member of that Church, which holdeth Chriſt as the head, and the Goſpel Covenant as the ground of Hope, (or if Baptiſm cannot be obtained, its <hi>being deſigned</hi> may be here conſiderable) and hereby according to their capacities, Infants do enter upon a profeſſion, and acceptance of the Chriſtian Faith, which their ſureties declare, and themſelves ſtand obliged to owne, when they come to years of underſtanding.

If Infants be <hi>ſavingly rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by Baptiſm,</hi> it would be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent piece of Charity to baptize <hi>Pagan In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> and even to <hi>murder baptized In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> becauſe many of theſe do after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by irreligion or debauchery, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to eternal damnation: but the former is oppoſite to Chriſtianity and the other to humanity. <hi>Anſ.</hi> There can be no <hi>act of Charity,</hi> but what is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way conformable to Chriſtian duty, and is no way injurious to the intereſts of men, and therefore the actions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this objection are far from being
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42052:136"/>charitable. Becauſe 1. To baptize <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> Infants, continuing with them under their <hi>education;</hi> would be to abuſe Gods Ordinance, by adminiſtring it to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects not duly qualified, according to the will of God; and therefore no ſaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit could be expected thereby to ſuch Infants; becauſe as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> expreſſeth it,<note place="margin">Eccleſ.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Sacraments are not phyſical but moral inſtruments of Salvation, which unleſs we perform as the Author of Grace requireth they are unprofitable.</hi> 2. To take Pagan Infants from them <hi>forcibly</hi> and <hi>unjuſtly,</hi> that they may be baptized, and educated in Chriſtianity, is no right act of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Charity: for though thoſe particular perſons might obtain that Salvation by <hi>embracing the Chriſtian life and doctrine,</hi> which they cannot enjoy in the purſuance of <hi>Pagan Idolatry:</hi> yet ſuch actions being againſt the right of their Parents, and thereby contrary to that <hi>juſtice and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> which Chriſtianity recommendeth, would greatly tend to the prejudice of the name of Chriſt in the World. 3. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Infants undertaken to be brought up in Chriſtianity and as it were <hi>adopted</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſtian Families, have by reaſon of that intended education, a <hi>right to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Baptiſm,</hi> as <hi>Abrahams</hi> Servants bought with money had to Circumciſion,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42052:136"/>with all others born in his Houſe: and if ſuch an Infant dye, ſo ſoon as it hath received Baptiſm, yet <hi>Fulgentius</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him <hi>factum eſſe haeredem Dei,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. As to the other part of this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Though it be certain (whatever we judge of Baptiſmal regeneration) that it had been <hi>better for every wicked man,</hi> never to have lived to commit thoſe hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſins, for which the <hi>wrath of God cometh upon the Children of diſobedience:</hi> yet there can be no more horrid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable action attempted in the World, than the murdering baptized Infants: which would be a <hi>wicked acting</hi> againſt the holy command of God, and extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to the <hi>meekneſs</hi> and goodneſs of Chriſtianity, and ſuch practices would tend to the ruin and extinguiſhing of the preſent Church of God, and to render Chriſtianity <hi>abhorred</hi> in the World, to the prejudice of many thouſands of Souls: and to the <hi>prejudice of theſe Infants,</hi> both in the loſs of their lives, and in hindring them of the opportunity of exerciſing pious and <hi>holy lives</hi> in the World; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God might be glorified, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves qualified through the grace of God, to partake of <hi>higher degrees of glory</hi> in the

And the advantage by this Ordinance of Baptiſm
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42052:137"/>is, that it is a performance on <hi>mans part,</hi> of what the Covenant of Grace requireth concerning <hi>Infants,</hi> and that it is on <hi>Gods part</hi> an Ordinance of Grace; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the benefits by Baptiſm, do flow from the <hi>Grace</hi> and Promiſe of God, and ought not to be conſidered in oppoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and even the advantage of baptized Infants dying in their Infancy, is the fruit of the grace of God and Predeſtination.<note place="margin">Wardi Theſ. n. <hi>36.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1.

Indeed there are ſome men who allow no <hi>ſpiritual efficacy</hi> to the Ordinance of Baptiſm, as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of grace; but this is an opinion ſo contrary to the nature of a Sacrament, and to the general Doctrine of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and the Proteſtant Churches, that it deſerveth to be earneſtly <hi>exploded.</hi>

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42052:148"/>of Jeſus Chriſt. This is evident from that Command of Chriſt. <hi>mat.</hi> 28.19. <gap reason="foreign">

That Infants are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being engaged to God, and may ſtand obliged <hi>to believe in God, and ſerve him,</hi> and to reject the ways of ſin and wickedneſs. This is manifeſt from the Circumciſion of Children under the Law, and from their little ones entring into Covenant with God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is encluded in the Baptiſm of Infants, which is <hi>a dedicating them</hi> unto God, and layeth an obligation upon them to entertain and perſevere in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Life and Faith, whether they have any Sureties or no: and he that owneth not this obligation from his Baptiſm, doth go far toward the <hi>renouncing of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi> 3. That when the Sureties anſwer in the Childs name, <hi>I believe, I renounce, &amp;c.</hi> this is a more ſolemn <hi>repreſentation
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42052:148"/>or declaration,</hi> of what the Child under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by his Baptiſm, and hereby as the Maſter of the ſentences determineth,<note place="margin">Sent. l. <hi>4.</hi> Diſt. <hi>6.</hi> g.</note> 
                     <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulus hac ſponſione tenebitur non ſponſor, the Child and not the ſurety ſtandeth bound by this engagement:</hi> only the <hi>Surety is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged</hi> to be careful of admoniſhing him. This explicite Declaration of what the baptized Infant undertaketh, is fitly uſed in Baptiſm, <hi>conformably to Antiquity,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it tendeth to expreſs clearly, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the deſign and end of Chriſtian Baptiſm, and to put all other baptized perſons in mind of their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they may live anſwerably there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And the matter of this <hi>baptiſmal vow</hi> being expreſſed in the publick Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Childs name, where all who are preſent may bear witneſs thereto, may be a conſiderable argument to be urged upon him when he cometh to Age, to induce him to the greater <hi>diligence</hi> in the Chriſtian life. And theſe words of the Sureties <hi>I believe, &amp;c.</hi> are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly words of promiſe of what they undertake ſhall be performed, but words <hi>expreſſing contract and engagement</hi> in the baptiſmal vow, and declaring in what profeſſion and practice, this Infant by his Baptiſm ſtandeth obliged to live and die.</p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:42052:149"/>
                  <p n="6">6. There is a further advantage by the the uſe of <hi>ſureties,</hi> in that they are (as is expreſſed in the exhortation to them) to ſee <hi>that the Child be taught, what a ſolemn vow, promiſe and profeſſion, he made in Baptiſm, that he be vertuouſly brought up.</hi> And that he be inſtructed in thoſe points of Chriſtianity, which <hi>a Chriſtian ought to know and believe to his Souls health,</hi> and to call upon him to <hi>hear Sermons.</hi> All this (which is in our Church required) may well be performed by the Surety, and <hi>impoſeth no heavy burden</hi> upon him, and (beſides the Parents care which may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be quickned) it may be of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the <hi>Religious life</hi> of the Child. The ancient Church either did require more than this from the <hi>Sureties,</hi>

                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:42052:149"/>the plain meaning thereof is, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, that the intent of the Childs being preſent, is to receive Baptiſm, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its account, and in its right and name they deſire for it. And when in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm there are theſe Queſtions and Anſwers. Q. <hi>What is required of perſons to be baptized?</hi> A. <hi>Repentance whereby they forſake ſin, and Faith whereby they ſtedfaſtly believe the promiſes of God, made to them in that Sacrament.</hi> Q. <hi>Why then are Infants baptized, when by reaſon of their tender age they cannot perform them?</hi> A. <hi>Becauſe they promiſe them both by their Sureties; which promiſe when they come to age themſelves are bound to perform:</hi> the ſenſe of the former anſwer is, that he who cometh to Chriſtian Baptiſm, is not left at liberty to lead a looſe life, but he ought to <hi>practiſe faith and repentance,</hi> as a previous qualification unto Baptiſm in the adult, and as a conſequent duty upon Baptiſm, both in them who are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in their Infancy, and at riper years. And the ſenſe of the latter Queſtion and Anſwer is, That though Infants be not capable of the particular <hi>acts of faith and repentance</hi> in their preſent ſtate, yet by thoſe expreſſions of contract, whereby their Sureties in their name only, declare what their Baptiſm obligeth them unto,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:42052:150"/>it is manifeſted that they do <hi>undertake faith and repentance,</hi> as much as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the infant ſtate, and do ſtand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged from their Baptiſm, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to act Faith and Repentance when they come to Age.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Another expreſſion in the baptiſmal Office hath been miſunderſtood: <hi>viz. Who by the Baptiſm of thy wel-beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt, didſt ſanctifie water to the myſtical waſhing away of ſin.</hi> Now we may well ſay that water is ſanctified for Baptiſm, when by divine authority water is ſelected from all other things, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be the proper matter, or outward Element of Baptiſm: and that is <hi>ſanctified</hi> which is ſet apart, or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, to ſuch a ſacred uſe, to which other common things are not admitted. And Chriſts Commiſſion to his Diſciples, to <hi>baptize all Nations, in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is an Authoritative determination of the form of Baptiſm, or the Sacramental words, and of the extent of its uſe. And both from thence and from our Saviours <hi>paſſion</hi> doth it receive an efficacious ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. But <hi>water</hi> was the <hi>matter of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Baptiſm,</hi> for the remiſſion of ſins, and admiſſion into the number of Chriſts Diſciples, before either that Commiſſion,

And let it be conſidered without prejudice, whether when our Saviour declared, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except you eat the ſteſh of the Son of man and drink his bloud, ye have no life in you;</hi> theſe words (though they cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to that Sacrament not then inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) do not ſufficiently declare, that he who hopeth for eternal life by Chriſt, may not ſafety <hi>neglect</hi> the careful atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on that Ordinance, which Chriſt
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42052:152"/>hath particularly appointed, to be the <hi>Communion</hi> of his body and bloud.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Concerning the <hi>Office for Matrimony,</hi> the words of contract will be moſt fitly diſcourſed of in another place, where I treat of the uſe of the Ring. I ſhall here only conſider ſuch Phraſes which ſome diſreliſh, that our Liturgy calleth it an <hi>holy Eſtate of Matrimony,</hi> and ſaith that <hi>God conſecrated the ſtate of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to ſuch an excellent Myſtery, that in it is ſignified and repreſented the ſpiritual marriage and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, between Chriſt and his Church.</hi> Now it is manifeſt, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle expreſſing the Marriage inſtitution and Union, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30, 31, 32. calleth it a <hi>great Myſtery,</hi> not as it referreth to the Huſband and Wife, but as it myſtically repreſenteth Chriſt and his Church; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>We are members of his fleſh, of his body, and of his bones. For this cauſe ſhall a man leave his Father, and Mother, and ſhall be joined unto his Wife, and they two ſhall be one fleſh. This is a great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the Church.</hi> And to theſe words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, the Phraſe of our Liturgy hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt reference.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And when it is ſaid to be <hi>conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> or to be a <hi>holy eſtate,</hi> this is as much as to ſay, that it is deſigned for a <hi>holy</hi> and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:42052:152"/>religious end and purpoſe. Though the Gentiles lived in laſciviouſneſs and all uncleanneſs; the Chriſtian marriage as well as the whole Chriſtian life is to be a holy eſtate, ſeparate from theſe pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>This is the will of God even your ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that you abſtain from fornication, that every one of you may know how to poſſeſs his Veſſel in ſanctification and honour, not in the luſts of concupiſcence,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. <hi>for God hath not called us to unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but unto holineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Chriſtian marriage is alſo an <hi>holy eſtate,</hi> as it is the lawful way, ſet apart and ordained, according to the will of God, for the increaſe of his Church.

                  <p n="6">6.

For as this would be an undertaking extreamly groundleſs and deeply uncharitable, ſo the very ſound thereof may be enough to <hi>affright Pagans</hi> from Chriſtianity, and <hi>Papiſts</hi> from the Reformation, if our ſelves did not allow ordinarily any hopes of the happy eſtate of the Members of our Church.</p>

And of this nature was the <hi>whole paedagogy</hi> of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Conſtitutions jointly conſidered, and every branch thereof ſo far as it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth an <hi>owning of Judaiſm,</hi> as the way of Gods acceptance: eſpecially <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, Sacrifice,</hi> and ſuch like ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Jewiſh Temple: the obſerving of which under the Goſpel, ſince the clear manifeſtation of Chriſtianity, would be to deny Chriſt to become in the fleſh; and to cloſe with that, as a way of <hi>obtaining

                  <p n="4">4. A ſecond inſtance concerneth the <hi>Garments,</hi> uſed in the attendance upon the Tabernacle or Temple Worſhip. The holy Garments of the High Prieſt, and the other Prieſts, and thoſe only were appointed of God.

And the <hi>Levites</hi> who carried the Ark, and who were Singers in that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, were alſo <hi>arrayed in Linen Robes</hi>

                     </note> And <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith that <hi>Solomon</hi> made for the <hi>Levites</hi>

                     <hi>two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Garment, of white Linen,</hi> Indeed <hi>Capellus</hi> juſtly accounteth this number to be <hi>incredible,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Capel. Templ. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineatio ex Villalpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</note> and it is very probably, that either the number is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved,</hi> or elſe <hi>Joſephus hyperbolizeth</hi> therein (as is frequent with the <hi>Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts</hi>) for the honour of his Nation. But that the uſe of <hi>white Linen Garments</hi> for the <hi>Levites,</hi> was more ancient than the times of <hi>David,</hi> may be collected from 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.18. where <hi>Samuel</hi> being yet a Child, is ſaid to have <hi>miniſtred before the Lord, being girded with a linen Ephod:</hi> and yet <hi>Samuel</hi> was only of the <hi>Levitical,</hi> but not of the <hi>Prieſtly</hi> race, and was not as <hi>yet known to be a Prophet of the Lord.</hi> Wherefore theſe Scriptures do ſpeak the <hi>allowableneſs</hi> of theſe <hi>Levitical</hi> Garments, eſpecially conſidering that they were uſed at the removal of the Ark, by <hi>David</hi>
                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:42052:168"/>himſelf and the <hi>Levites,</hi> after the time that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> was ſmitten, becauſe they <hi>ſerved not the Lord after the due order.</hi> Yet is there not ſo much as as any dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that any ſuch garments ſhould either be made for, or uſed by any other of the <hi>Levites,</hi> beſides the Prieſts.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A third inſtance is the <hi>Altar of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> built by the two Tribes and half when they went over <hi>Jordan</hi> to their own poſ2eſſion; which after a jealous inquiry by <hi>Phinehas</hi> and all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, was well approved of, when it appeared that it was not a <hi>forſaking the God of Iſrael,</hi> or a diſobeying his commands, and renouncing his Temple Worſhip: but was only a <hi>monumental Memorial</hi> of their profeſſion of the true God, and having a right to do his ſervice at the Temple; and thereupon did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude an inciting and ingaging them to the true Religion, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 22.31, 32, 33.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A fourth inſtance is <hi>the Temple it ſelf,</hi> as it was deſigned by <hi>David,</hi> for the greater <hi>ſplendour</hi> of Gods Service, and higher honour of his Name. For though God had commanded a Tabernacle to accompany <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their ſojournings, and had given no <hi>Commandment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Temple,</hi> as himſelf expreſſeth, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:42052:168"/>7.7. that holy man had deſigned to build a Temple to the Lord, humbly judging it greatly unreaſonable, that he ſhould <hi>dwell in an houſe of Cedar, while the Ark of God dwelt within Curtains,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.2. And this deſign of <hi>David</hi> was well <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> of by <hi>Nathan, verſ.</hi> 3. and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf declared, that <hi>he did well in that it was in his heart,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.17, 18. and thereupon God promiſed <hi>David,</hi> that he would <hi>make him an houſe, and ſet up his ſeed after him and eſtabliſh his Kingdom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.11, 12. and did command, that the thing which <hi>David</hi> purpoſed ſhould be <hi>effected,</hi> not by himſelf who was a <hi>man of wars,</hi> but by his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.8, 9, 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.3, 4, 5, 6. And it muſt be conſidered, that the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Meſes</hi> was never enjoyned,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Chr.</hi> 16. 1. <hi>Chr.</hi> 17.5.</note> to be the <hi>perpetual habitation</hi> of Gods preſence ſo long as the Jewiſh Diſpenſation ſhould continue: and therefore though <hi>David</hi> did not build the Temple, yet he <hi>pitched another Tent</hi> for the Ark of God at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> where it abode many years, while the Tabernacle of <hi>Moſes</hi> was at <hi>Gibeon,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1, 3, 4. but neither was that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction nor his deſign to build a Temple, contrary to any command of God; but was only a <hi>determination of 2omewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi> relating to the Service of God,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42052:169"/>to expreſs his higher honour and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of God and Religion; which was therefore <hi>approved</hi> of God, though it was not particularly <hi>commanded</hi> by him.<note place="margin">Seder O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam Rab. c. <hi>11.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. I know that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers do aſſert, <hi>that the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>did command the building the Temple;</hi> (by which I here underſtand a houſe of ſtone and Cedar as diſtinguiſhed from the Tabernacle) this ſeemeth to be affirmed by <hi>Maimonides,</hi>

                  <p n="8">8.

                  <p n="9">9. Secondly, I ſhall conſider the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue Worſhip of the Jews,</hi> which hath a nearer alliance to the Chriſtian Worſhip. In their Synagogues they aſſembled to profeſs and owne God and his Law, to hear his Word, to praiſe his Name, and call upon him, and to perform other ſuch like Duties. And this was not chiefly a <hi>Ceremonial Worſhip,</hi> as that of the Temple was; but a <hi>Moral Worſhip,</hi> or ſuch a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as conſiſted of Duties, which in the general nature of them, are perpetually obligatory upon all the Servants of God in this World, and not upon the <hi>Jews</hi> only, nor were they <hi>peculiar to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Conſtitutions.</hi> And concerning this which was their ordinary, weekly, and indeed a principal Worſhip of God, it is truly obſerved by Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi>

                  <p n="10">10. A firſt inſtance I here give of the liberty of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, making determinations concerning things exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal velating to Religion, is touching the <hi>Ordination</hi> of the Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Officers</hi> of

And yet that all who were the <hi>Synagogal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi> or who were admitted to teach there, (except the extraordinary caſe of Prophets) were ordained thereto by <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands,</hi> and what their different manners of Ordination were, according as they committed to them different power or authority of teaching or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is ſufficiently from the <hi>Jewiſh Forms</hi> declared by Mr. <hi>Selden.</hi>

                  <p n="18">18.

                     </note> that <hi>he could never receive any ſatisfaction, though he had oft conſidered with himſelf, and enquired of others, why a preſcribed form of words, and the uſe of the ſolemnity of external Rites, either ought not as things ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be removed from the Religious uſe of an Oath; or elſe may not as uſeful helps of piety, be retained in the other parts of Gods worſhip.</hi> I know that ſome have told us, that an Oath is not a part of the <hi>natural worſhip</hi> of God, belonging to the firſt commandment; nor of the <hi>inſtituted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>

But indeed all this is but a plauſible miſtake.

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:42052:193"/>the true worſhippers, ſhall worſhip the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſpirit and truth:</hi> collecting thence, that the Goſpel worſhip is ſo wholly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, that it doth not admit outward Rites and ſigns. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1.

Our bleſſed Lord by theſe words of <hi>worſhipping the Father in ſpirit and truth,</hi> expreſſeth that worſhip which the Goſpel directeth; this is often called the <hi>truth,</hi> and the <hi>worſhipping of God in the Spirit.

And in this place our Saviour declareth, that under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the worſhip of God ſhould be ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſuitable to God who is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> that it ſhould not be confined to any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place, and therefore neither the

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:42052:206"/>direct means of conveying further Grace from God; would enclude a cenſuring any particular becoming <hi>actions, gravity,</hi> and due expreſſion of <hi>affectionateneſs</hi> in the Miniſter or people in Chriſtian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, becauſe it is a means to excite others to the greater reverence, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious devotion; and would condemn any actions as <hi>ſinful</hi> and evil, meerly from their being <hi>uſeful</hi> to promote good.

                     <note place="margin">Can. Ap. <hi>70.</hi> Conc. Laod. c. <hi>38.</hi> Con. Trul. c. <hi>11.</hi>

                  <p n="16">16. So that here is a Caſe, where ſome determination is neceſſary to the due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the regular adminiſtration of Gods Ordinance, where either leavened or unleavened Bread muſt be received; both theſe have been hotly oppoſed; the one ſide ſeeming to be favoured by the <hi>inſtitution of Chriſt,</hi> and the other by the <hi>abrogation of the law,</hi> but neither of their arguments are concluſive, againſt the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the others practice. In like

Both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> (as well as other Proteſtant) Churches, have theſe things determined; though both in the habit and geſture, they differ from us, and from each other: and yet there may be <hi>objections</hi> and pretences of <hi>diſlike</hi> raiſed againſt thoſe particular habits and geſtures, as well as againſt ours (as may in another place be ſhewed): Wherefore either ſome things which may become or have been <hi>matters of diſpute</hi> may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be ordered by Eccleſiaſtical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or elſe there can be no ſecurity for the orderly exerciſe of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. To theſe arguments it may be added, that the <hi>prudence of the Church</hi> would appear very contemptible to its adverſaries, if either its rules or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about matters of order, ſhould be as

                  <p n="21">21. Firſt, that theſe directions given by the Apoſtle, in the beginning of this Chapter, ſo far as they give <hi>allowance</hi> to the different practices therein mentioned have a peculiar reſpect to thoſe times only of the firſt dawning of Chriſtianity; when moſt of the Jews who believed in Chriſt did as yet zealouſly retain the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Rites; abſtaining from certain meats as <hi>judging them unlawful and unclean, Rom.</hi> 14.2, 14. and obſerving Jewiſh days and times out of a <hi>peculiar eſteem</hi> for them, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and yet this <hi>for a time</hi> was in this Chapter allowed and indulged by the Apoſtle. But <hi>afterwards</hi> the Rules and Canons of the Church ſeverely condemned all Chriſtians whether of Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,<note place="margin">Auguſt. Ep. <hi>19.</hi> Conc.

Wherefore we muſt further obſerve, that in the Apoſtles times and according to the Rules they delivered to the Church, The <hi>Gentile Chriſtians</hi> were in theſe things with others <hi>prohibited</hi> the obſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and its Ceremonies, though many of them (as the <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians</hi>) were prone to judge this to be their neceſſary duty. <hi>Act.</hi> 21.25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. The <hi>Jews among the Gentiles,</hi> who did not yet underſtand that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was abrogated, were <hi>allowed</hi> to obſerve its Rites, and to practiſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Jewiſh Cuſtoms, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.21, 24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.3. But the <hi>Jews</hi> who lived in <hi>Judea</hi> (and S. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when he was there) were <hi>obliged or enjoined,</hi> to obſerve the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Rites, though they were ſatisfied, that the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of the Law was abrogated. <hi>Act.</hi> 21.24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.12. Now in theſe different practices <hi>allowed, determined,</hi> and <hi>ordered</hi> by the directions and rules given by the Apoſtles, as <hi>temporary proviſions</hi> for the ſeveral ſorts or different Churches of Chriſtians; the Apoſtle requireth the Romans to receive and not to judge one another.</p>

                     </note> was juſtly condemned, as an errour vented by ſome wild Spirits, in our former times of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs: and yet this cannot be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by thoſe who will aſſert, that the <hi>poſtures of the Lords Supper</hi> ought to be correſpondent to thoſe at <hi>ordinary Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi> Wherefore this objection though earneſtly inſiſted upon, is built upon an <hi>unſound Foundation.</hi> But when S. <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the abuſes at <hi>Corinth</hi> about their <hi>Agapae</hi> which attended the Lords Supper,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22.</note> ſaying, <hi>Have ye not Houſes to eat and to drink in?</hi> it was well from thence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by <hi>Zanchy,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. But it is more generally by many amongſt us objected, that kneeling at this Sacrament is contrary to the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and practice of Chriſt</hi> and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who <hi>ſate</hi> at the inſtitution of the Lords Supper. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. There is no <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> concerning the <hi>geſture</hi> uſed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles at the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. There are ſome good Writers both ancient and Modern, who ſpeak either <hi>variouſly</hi> or <hi>doubtfully,</hi> concerning his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture at the Paſsover: but I think it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evident, eſpecially from S. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. and <hi>John</hi> 21.20. that he
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:42052:247"/>did eat the Paſsover with his Diſciples <hi>in a diſcumbing geſture</hi> (which geſture becauſe it is wholly out of uſe with us, is expreſſed in our Engliſh Tranſlation by <hi>ſitting,</hi> becauſe it was a Table geſture). Now they who urge this Objection take for granted, becauſe the Lords Supper was inſtituted before the Paſchal Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities were <hi>fully ended,</hi> that our Saviour continued all that time in the ſame ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; againſt the <hi>certainty,</hi> yea or <hi>probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of which, I alledge three things. 1. That it was the ordinary Cuſtom of the Jews,<note place="margin">V. Hor. Hebr. in Mat. <hi>26.20.</hi>
                     </note> to <hi>change their geſture</hi> during the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>Paſchal Feaſt.</hi> At the beginning of their Feaſt, they did <hi>diſcumb</hi> and ſo continued till they had eaten the Cake of Unleavened Bread, and drunk the two former Cups of Wine, as both the <hi>Talmud</hi> and <hi>Buxtorf</hi> do relate;<note place="margin">Buxt. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daic. c. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note> but at the time of the two latter Cups of Wine, and at the eating their bitter Herbs the ſame geſture was not <hi>required, nor uſed,</hi> as the <hi>Talmud</hi> in <hi>Berachoth,</hi> and <hi>Peſachin</hi> doth expreſs; and here <hi>Buxtorf</hi> ſaith, <hi>reclinati non comedunt.</hi> 2. That the Jews who in their ſolemn Feaſts did eat diſcumbing, yet in their <hi>giving thanks</hi> before thoſe Feaſts,<note place="margin">Phil. de Vit. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temp.</note> they were (as <hi>Philo</hi> relateth) in a <hi>ſtanding geſture,</hi> with their eyes and hands lifted up towards Heaven; and
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:42052:248"/>therefore it is no way probable, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſhould continue in their <hi>Table geſture,</hi> (which this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection muſt ſuppoſe) at the <hi>bleſſing the holy Supper,</hi> which is an higher Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance than the Paſsover was, becauſe this would be very unſuitable to ſo great a ſolemnity. 3. That there anpeareth no <hi>footſteps</hi> of any Cuſtom of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, of receiving the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per either <hi>ſitting</hi> or <hi>diſcumbing,</hi> (of which the following Section will give ſome further account.)</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. There is no <hi>obligation of duty</hi> upon the Chriſtian Church, to keep to that geſture in the Lords Supper, which was uſed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, though it could be evidently diſcovered: becauſe 1. Chriſt hath given no <hi>command</hi> concerning the geſture, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he telleth his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> what he had <hi>received from the Lord and delivered unto them</hi> concerning this holy Sacrament, maketh no mention at all therein of any <hi>geſture.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 24, 25. Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> therefore well aſſerteth, that Chriſt ſaid not.<note place="margin">Reply to Hard. Art. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Do this after Supper, or ſitting, or being ſo many together, neither did the Apoſtles ever ſo underſtand him.</hi> 2. Chriſt and his Apoſtles obſerved that <hi>Paſsover geſture</hi> which was uſually received among
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:42052:248"/>the Jews though it was different from the geſture at its firſt inſtitution; of which I have diſcourſed ſomewhat in a former Chapter. 3. Other <hi>circumſtances of like nature</hi> attendant upon the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Lords Supper,<note place="margin">Ch. <hi>1.</hi> Sect. <hi>2.</hi> n. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acknowledged to be of no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary obligation unto Chriſtians in after times. Biſhop <hi>Saunderſon</hi> noteth that whereas thoſe four laſt predicaments, <hi>ubi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Oblig. Conſc. Prael. <hi>3.</hi> Sect. <hi>16,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>quando, ſitus, habitus; where, when, the geſture, and the habit,</hi> are of a like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it is almoſt generally acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we are not obliged to make uſe of a <hi>like place</hi> for the celebrating the Lords Supper, (an upper room) nor the <hi>ſame time,</hi> (at night at the end of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) nor of the <hi>ſame habit,</hi> (a ſeemleſs Coat woven throughout) but <hi>only the geſture is urged as neceſſary,</hi> for which there can be no more reaſon than for the other; yea though there be more <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> concerning the geſture, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any of the other three.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3. There is no reaſon at all to conclude that Chriſt and his Apoſtles <hi>ſate</hi> at this inſtitution. Now though I know no evidence againſt our Saviour his <hi>uſing a geſture of Prayer and Worſhip</hi> at the time of celebrating the Lords Supper; which is the more probable, becauſe ſuch was
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:42052:249"/>the general practice of the ancient Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, I ſhall for the preſent ſuppoſe that he uſed the ſame geſture at the Lords Supper, and at the Paſsover; yet then I muſt obſerve, 1. That this <hi>diſcumbing geſture</hi> was vaſtly different from ſitting. 2. That if this ſuppoſed geſture uſed at the inſtitution was <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or of neceſſity</hi> to the Sacrament, they who undertake to change <hi>diſcumbing</hi> into <hi>ſitting,</hi> upon pretence that that is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Table geſture in theſe Countries, muſt undertake to aſſert that the <hi>intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing new Cuſtoms</hi> among men-may have power to alter the neceſſary and <hi>eſſential duties</hi> of Gods Ordinances; which is a poſition deſtructive to Religion and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: for if any Company of men ſhould enure themſelves to a diet where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ordinarily allow themſelves nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bread nor Wine,</hi> this will in no wiſe warrant their undertaking to celebrate this Sacrament in any <hi>other Elements,</hi> where theſe Elements may be as eaſily had and uſed, as men may compoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a <hi>reclining or diſcumbing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Wherefore we are firſt to conſider, what Warrant this impoſition of hands in Confirmation may claim from the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Apoſtles.</hi> We read, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.15, 17, 18. that after <hi>Philip</hi> had baptized at <hi>Samaria,</hi> by the Apoſtles prayer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>impoſition of hands,</hi> they received the Holy Ghoſt: and the ſame is related concerning the Diſciples at <hi>Epheſus, Act.</hi> 19.6. Here we have an
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:42052:274"/>Apoſtolical practice evident, that they <hi>impoſed hands</hi> and prayed, and thereupon the Holy Ghoſt was received. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed acknowledged, that in thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances there was a viſible and <hi>miraculous teſtimony</hi> of the preſence of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by <hi>ſpeaking with Tongues,</hi> &amp;c. but the chief bleſſing of Gods Spirit conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the <hi>inward Graces</hi> of the Spirit, which were not peculiar to that time; and that the obtaining the ſtrengthning grace of the Spirit, was in an eſpecial manner deſigned by the Apoſtles impoſition of hands, is declared by <hi>Irenaeus;</hi>

<pb n="526" facs="tcp:42052:275"/>not receive the increaſe of the grace and ſtrength of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical <hi>impoſition</hi> of hands, is alſo aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the place above-mentioned by <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus.</hi> And if any perſons will contend, that the <hi>impoſition of hands</hi> now received in the Church, cannot be a practice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of the Apoſtles, becauſe in thoſe times the Holy Ghoſt was oft <hi>miraculouſly received,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now be expected; he may as well aſſert that the <hi>impoſition of hands</hi> for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, is not continued in the Church from the example of the Apoſtles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then the Holy Ghoſt was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times extraordinarily given thereby; or that our <hi>praying and preaching</hi> is not a doing that, for which we have the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles for an example, becauſe we cannot by them expect ſuch <hi>wonderful gifts</hi> as ſometimes were conferred under the Apoſtles doctrine and by their prayer.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. The uſe of <hi>Confirmation</hi> in our Church, beſides the leaving out things ſuperſtitious, hath <hi>two great advantages</hi> in its external adminiſtration.

For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and ſtrength of grace, which is then implored, and the being received to a higher rank of Chriſtian profeſſion, doth reaſonably ſuppoſe a <hi>capacity of knowledge</hi> and underſtanding. Indeed in the early times of Chriſtianity, while Baptiſm was ordinarily adminiſtred to perſons <hi>adult,</hi> the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of their Faith, together with their taking upon them the practice of the Chriſtian life, went before their Baptiſm; and thence not only <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi> but the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> was ſoon after adminiſtred to them: and yet it is not amiſs obſerved by <hi>Kemnitius,</hi>

                  <p n="9">9. But it remaineth to be inquired, how the Church can <hi>certifie</hi> the perſons confirmed, by the <hi>ſign of Impoſition of hands, of Gods favour and gracious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards them.</hi> For the anſwering of which, waving other conſiderations, I ſhall obſerve two things. Firſt, that as
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:42052:279"/>this impoſition of hands is a teſtimony of admitting perſons, to a higher rank of Chriſtian Profeſſors, who ratifie their baptiſmal Covenant by their own action, (intimating alſo an approbation of this profeſſion) it includeth the <hi>power of the Keys,</hi> whereby the Officers of the Church are enabled by Gods authority, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare particularly his <hi>favour and gracious goodneſs</hi> to them who embrace the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſtianity, and to direct them thereunto; and to this purpoſe was <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands</hi> on the <hi>Penitents,</hi> at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times, uſed in the ancient Church. And to <hi>teſtifie Gods gracious acceptance</hi> (either by our words or actions) of mens undertaking the exerciſe of Chriſtianity, is a thing greatly different, from the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the divine grace of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as <hi>exhibited by any ſign,</hi> as a means to <hi>convey</hi> the ſame, which is the proper nature of a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Secondly, This Impoſition of hands is a ſign of a <hi>Benediction</hi> in Gods name from the Officer of Gods Church. The <hi>Levites,</hi> and eſpecially the Prieſts under the Law, were required to <hi>bleſs the people in the name of God, Deut.</hi> 10.8. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.13. which bleſſing was performed in a way of <hi>benedictory prayer</hi> or ſupplication, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23. and this bleſſing in Gods
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:42052:279"/>name, was a teſtimony of <hi>Gods giving his bleſſing</hi> to them, (ſuppoſing them not to render themſelves uncapable thereof) <hi>Num.</hi> 6.27. The external teſtimony of their general bleſſing all the people,<note place="margin">Targ. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nath. in Num. <hi>6.23.</hi>
                     </note> was moſt probably by <hi>lifting up their hands</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, as is declared by one of the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſts, and is obſerved by <hi>Baronius;</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. And as to the word <hi>(Worſhip)</hi> it is here evidently taken for an expreſſion of civil honour, reſpect, and eminency, which was a more uſual acceptation of that Phraſe in the laſt Age, than now it is, as may appear from theſe words of Mr. <hi>Tyndal:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tyndall againſt Sir Tho. More.</note> 
                     <hi>Concerning worſhipping or honouring, which two terms</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are both one; the words which the Scripture
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:42052:286"/>doth uſe, in the worſhipping or honouring of God are theſe, to love God, cleave to him, &amp;c. all which words</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we uſe alſo in the worſhipping of man, howbeit diverſly, and the difference thereof doth all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture teach.</hi> Nor is the word <hi>Worſhip</hi> in its common uſe ſo perticuliarly now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to divine Worſhip; but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ordinary title of <hi>Worſhip</hi> in a civil ſenſe given to men, we alſo read in the laſt Tranſlation of our Bibles, ſuch Phraſes as theſe, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.20. <hi>they worſhipped God and the King; i. e.</hi> gave due honour, reverence, and obeiſance both to God and the King. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.10. then ſhalt thou <hi>have worſhip in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of them that ſit at meat with thee.</hi> Rev. 3.9. <hi>I will make them come and worſhip before thy feet:</hi> and in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter Verſions there occurreth a much more frequent uſe of ſuch Phraſes. And therefore theſe words, <hi>With my body I thee worſhip</hi> are not unallowable in the Phraſe, and are very ſignificant, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, and of great moment, in their ſenſe, deſign and intent.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And now having impartially and diligently conſidered thoſe appointments in our Church, which for an hundred years paſt have been by divers perſons ſo <hi>ſeverely cenſured</hi> and oppoſed, (though
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:42052:287"/>by others <hi>worthily defended</hi> and juſtly valued) the reſult is this.</p>
                  <p n="9">9.

                  <p n="10">10.

                  <p n="11">11. Thirdly, That thoſe perſons who will reſolvedly oppoſe with <hi>violence,</hi> theſe eſtabliſhments in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>renounce its Communion</hi> upon any accounts referring to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, and way of Worſhip appointed therein, may obſerve that almoſt all the ſame things which they blame in our Church, and for which they injuriouſly depart from it, have been <hi>received and appointed</hi> (with many other things, which their Principles do equally or more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely condemn) in the Primitive Church, and eſpecially in the third, fourth, and fifth Centuries, (of the Rites and way of Worſhip, in which Ages we have more ample records than of the the times foregoing) and had they then lived, they muſt upon the ſame accounts, according to their preſent Principles and practices, have diſclaimed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all the <hi>famous known Churches</hi> of the Chriſtian World in thoſe Ages, which have been, and deſerve to be greatly renowned.
